<h2>Book Lovers: A Gifting Guide</h2>
<p>11.4.2016</p>
<img alt="" src="/theme/images/christmas-book.jpg" style="height: 400px;">
<p>I know, I know. It's too early.  But...is it? I feel like I go through
this every year: it's always too early to start thinking about the
holidays until December 20th, and then I'm scrambling to find or make
good gifts for my family and friends. I don't know about you, but I do
<em>not</em> work best under that kind of pressure. I also don't have the
foresight to do what my mom does and just shop for presents
year-round, finding things she thinks people will like. We can't all
be planners.</p>
<p>So, November 4th seems like a good enough in between. And what better
gift is there to give than a good story?  Whether your
recipient is an enthusiastic reader or hasn't picked up a book in
years, I think there's something for everyone at the local book store.
Here are my recommendations, no matter who you're giving to!</p>
<div class="section" id="for-the-non-reader">
<h2>For the Non-Reader</h2>
<p>This is definitely the hardest person to buy a book for. But with
the rise of audiobooks, coloring books, and graphic novels
I think you can find something for everyone! Let's break it down.</p>
<div class="section" id="audiobooks">
<h3>Audiobooks</h3>
<p>I can't overstate how much I love audiobooks. I spend so much time
walking, running, doing laundry, cooking, stretching, <em>doing</em>, and
being able to spend that time with a book in my ears has been
life changing. I use <a class="reference external" href="http://app.overdrive.com/">Overdrive</a> (way better than Audible!), which
connects to your local library and lets you download e-books and
audiobooks to any device, including <em>your phone</em>. <strong>For free</strong>.
Fancy, right? Here's how you can turn that into a non-reader gift:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Set it up</strong>. Installing the app, connecting it to the library,
downloading books, connecting the phone to the
car...it can be a lot. Getting everything ready to go so your loved
one just has to press 'play' could be the push they need to remember
how much they love books!</li>
<li><strong>CDs</strong>. I know I know I know. But again, sometimes setting it all
up on the phone is just too much.  Give your loved one a book on
tape they can play in the car. Especially perfect if you've got an
upcoming road trip!</li>
<li><strong>Your own recommendations</strong>. Sharing a book together is a beautiful
thing. Seeing a novel through someone else's eyes can open up new
perspectives, interpretations, and meaning you may not have seen.
And you get to share a thing you love with a person you love.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="coloring-books">
<h3>Coloring Books</h3>
<p>You've seen them.  You've thought &quot;Really? Adult coloring books?&quot;.
Your friend's mom has one. And now, your mom can have one too!
Coloring is meditative, methodic, excellent to keep your hands busy
while watching TV.  Here are a few that look neat:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.powells.com/book/secret-garden-an-inky-treasure-hunt-coloring-book-9781780671062/1-20">The Secret Garden</a>. Kind of the OG coloring book.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.powells.com/book/color-me-calm-100-coloring-templates-for-meditation-relaxation-9781937994778/1-0">Color Me Calm</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.powells.com/book/pride-prejudice-a-coloring-classic-9781524701123/1-1">Pride and Prejudice: A Coloring Classic</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Find more of them <a class="reference external" href="http://www.powells.com/books/childrens/activities/coloring-books">at Powell's</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="graphic-novels">
<h3>Graphic Novels</h3>
<p>Not just for kids! Graphic novels have grown into beautifully
illustrated, intricate stories with as much character development,
plot, and meaning as any other book.  Here are a few that are really
stunning:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25179.Blankets">Blankets</a> by Craig Thompson. This was definitely the first graphic
novel I read where I realized what a graphic novel could be.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22040598-the-sculptor">The Sculptor</a> by Scott McCloud. Per the recommendation of my SO, a
graphic novel fan.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="for-the-history-buff">
<h2>For the History Buff</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27209433-white-trash">White Trash: The 400-Year Untold History of Class in America</a> by
Nancy Isenberg. America is hardly classless,
anybody-can-be-anything country  we like to think it is. This book
recounts the history of the mistreatment of the poor, and discusses
the surprising origins of elitism in the US (hint: owning land used
to be a BFD).</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077874-hrc">HRC</a> by Amie Parnes and Jonathan Allen. You may as well start
reading up on the life and times of our future president ;) It
focuses on her time as Secretary of State, but I think it has great
insight into how she makes decisions, what motivates her, and is
relatively objective and accurate.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="for-the-girl-boss">
<h2>For the Girl Boss</h2>
<p>By far the hardest category to narrow down, it's hard to go wrong with
any of these titles for the feminist reader (woops, sorry, I
misspelled 'everyone') in your life:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29340182-shrill">Shrill</a> by Lindy West. So many 'aha' moments in this book.
Lindy West names and confronts some uncomfortable truths in this
book.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll become a better human.
Really you should just get it for yourself as a present.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29405093-the-girl-with-the-lower-back-tattoo">The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo</a> by Amy Schumer. An incredibly
intimate look into who Amy Schumer is, and how she came to be the
person she is today.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12262741-wild">Wild</a> by Cheryl Strayed. I know this book was trendier last year,
but if your loved one didn't get a chance to read it it's well worth
coming back to.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17851885-i-am-malala">I am Malala</a> by Malala Yousafzai. If you're not sure who she is,
you <em>definitely</em> need to read this.  If you know her, you know why
you need to read this.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20910157-yes-please">Yes, Please</a> by Amy Pohler. The life and times of an amazing
woman, featuring some great advice we could all use.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="for-the-mathlete">
<h2>For the Mathlete</h2>
<p>These are ordered by difficulty + level of math, from most advanced to
most accessible.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24113.G_del_Escher_Bach">Gödel, Escher, Bach</a> by Douglas Hofstadter is a mind-bending, brain-exploding math +
philosophy book. This is perfect your friend who just started grad
school.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17290683-love-and-math">Love and Math</a> by Edward Frenkel is just a great math book.  Part memoir, part
linear algebra, Edward Frenkel discusses how he came to love math,
what he endured to be part of the mathematics community, and what he
spent his life researching and discovering.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693884-how-not-to-be-wrong">How Not to Be Wrong</a> by Jordan Ellenberg is for the armchair mathematician. It's a
critical analysis of how we approach problems, and common data
analytics methods.  More &quot;How to think about this real-world issue&quot; than
&quot;Here's how Andrew Wiles solved the Fermat Theorem&quot;.  My favorite
quote is:
<em>&quot;And you can't deny that there are aspects of the natural
world - I'm thinking pandas here - that seem more likely to have
resulted from grudging bureaucratic compromise than from the mind of
an all knowing deity with total creative control&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="for-the-csi-fan">
<h2>For the CSI Fan</h2>
<p>I've unexpectedly started reading mysteries recently. I
didn't even know what I was getting myself into, but here are a few
juicy ones I've enjoyed.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27274343-i-m-thinking-of-ending-things">I'm Thinking of Ending Things</a> by Iain Reid. A short but
satisfying thriller.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26114146-all-is-not-forgotten">All is Not Forgotten</a> by Wendy Walker. As a mystery noob, I'm <em>so</em>
invested in this book. Is it the son?  The pot dealer? I was hooked,
and so satisfied by the ending.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22557272-the-girl-on-the-train">The Girl on the Train</a> by Paula Hawkins. Honestly, when I first read it I
thought it was a little meh. I had a hard time connecting to the
main character, or caring about what happened to her. But with all
the hype + the movie, I may have to give it another read.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="for-the-friend-with-a-bb8-pillow">
<h2>For the Friend with a BB8 Pillow</h2>
<p>AKA Sci-Fi.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9969571-ready-player-one">Ready Player One</a> by Ernest Cline is a totally accessible and fun
story. It's a classic hero's tale, with 80's geek and gamer culture
mixed in. Highly recommend for readers of any age.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12007.Use_of_Weapons">Use of Weapons</a> by Iain Banks is by far my favorite sci-fi book.
Great characters, an excellent ending, compelling plot, and very
interesting premise. Highly, highly recommend for all readers</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59924.The_Lathe_of_Heaven">The Lathe of Heaven</a> by Ursula K. LeGuin is a solid, satisfying
sci-fi adventure.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="for-the-people-person">
<h2>For the People Person</h2>
<p>This section is really just an excuse to recommend <a class="reference internal" href="#when-breath-becomes-air">When Breath
Becomes Air</a>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference internal" href="#when-breath-becomes-air">When Breath Becomes Air</a> by Paul Kalanathi is the heartbreaking
story of a young neurosurgeon diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer.
Intimate with the American healthcare system as both a doctor and a
patient, this book has fascinating insights and thoughts around the
ultimate question: <em>What makes life worth living?</em></li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="#the-audacity-of-hope">The Audacity of Hope</a> by Barack Obama, for when you need to
revitalize your faith in our country's politicians.</li>
</ul>
<p id="the-audacity-of-hope"><span id="when-breath-becomes-air"></span>And that's all she wrote, folks! I hope you have a wonderful holiday
season, surrounded by family and friends you love ♥</p>
