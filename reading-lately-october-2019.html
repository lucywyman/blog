<h2>Reading Lately: October 2019</h2>
<p>11.1.2019</p>
<div class='parent'>
  <img alt="" src="/theme/images/october-2019.jpg" style="height: 400px;">
</div>
<p>October was a crazy month. I ran the Portland Half-Marathon, spoke at Puppetize PDX, started a DnD
campaign (not as DM, just playing!), and of course went to a pumpkin patch. Everything we did was
fun, and the weather in Portland was <em>gorgeous</em>. It's been a beautiful, wonderful, spooky October,
and I'm admittedly sad to see it end. I'm also looking forward to Thanksgiving and more time with
family though, so can hardly complain. This month's books were, overall, not great. I've maxed out
my holds at the library and books are taking FOREVER to come in now (<a class="reference external" href="https://p2a.co/fgcQkzV">fuck publishers</a>), so I'm
ending up with books that happen to be available a bit more. Anywho, here's what I read:</p>
<div class="section" id="jane-steele-4-5">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25868918-jane-steele">Jane Steele</a>: 4/5</h2>
<p><em>Lyndsay Faye</em></p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="" src="theme/images/jane-steele.jpg" style="height: 300px;" />
</div>
<p>Despite not having read Jane Eyre (which the novel is inspired by and frequently references) I found
I connected a lot with this book, and mostly with it's heroine. Jane Steele, as her name suggests,
is a strong-willed and righteous murderer - though she only murders <em>horrible</em> men who have wronged
the women in their lives! So...it's kind of ok. She's like a 19th century English Dexter, although a
bit more sympathetic. What I liked about Jane was how strong her relationships in the book were -
her complex friendship with her best friend Clark, her protective instincts toward those who help
her, and ultimately her love interest. Jane reads like living in the mind of a real person, with
doubts and convictions and feelings all expressed throughout the book. It was fun to live in her
crazy and curious world for a while, and I'd definitely read a sequel!</p>

<div class="section" id="okay-fine-whatever-2-5">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35397338-okay-fine-whatever">Okay, Fine, Whatever</a>: 2/5</h2>
<p><em>Courtenay Hameister</em></p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="" src="theme/images/okay-fine-whatever.jpg" style="height: 300px;" />
</div>
<p>Honestly...this title feels appropriate. I wanted to like this more than I did, especially after
reading about how hard Hameister takes criticism (I'm sorry!). But the book just didn't resonate
with me. As someone with very mild anxiety I thought I could connect to someone overcoming their
fears, and in Portland OR no less. It turns out Hameister and I don't share the same anxieties or
coping mechanisms, and throughtout the book I mostly just thought &quot;Oh thank God I'm not her&quot;. Don't
worry, she gets a happy ending, and the book isn't as much of a downer as I'm making it out to be.
If you are experiencing anxiety, or evaluating making a change in your life, I think this book would
be more meaningful. It just wasn't for me.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-bookish-life-of-nina-hill-3-5">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42379022-the-bookish-life-of-nina-hill">The Bookish Life of Nina Hill</a>: 3/5</h2>
<p><em>Abbi Waxman</em></p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="" src="theme/images/bookish-life-of-nina-hill.jpg" style="height: 300px;" />
</div>
<p>This was a sweet but forgettable rom-com read. Nina Hill is an almost-great character, a cliche
bookworm who struggles with her love life. What I liked most about Nina was what a strong network of
female friends she had. From coworkers to her trivia team, Nina was introverted without being
isolated. I also liked that the conflict in the book was both realistic....and towards the end a bit
silly and off-the-rails ðŸ™‚. If you're looking for a palate-cleanser or an easy read, this is a fun
one.</p>

<div class="section" id="how-to-bake-pi-3-5-5">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23360039-how-to-bake-pi">How to Bake Pi</a>: 3.5/5</h2>
<p><em>Eugenia Cheng</em></p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="" src="theme/images/how-to-bake-pi.jpg" style="height: 300px;" />
</div>
<p>I loved the thesis of this book, my only complaint was that it was hammered home a few too many
times. And for good reason, since most of us spend our <em>entire childhoods</em> learning that math is
rigid, and strict, and hard. Cheng aims to break that misconception by demonstrating how math is
creative and fun, how it's about breaking the rules of math and seeing what happens (like with
imaginary numbers). She attempts to rebuild our understanding of what math is from the ground up
using metaphors and real-world scenarios, and illustrates her points beautifully. This is a
fantastic book for a teen or pre-teen wondering why they need to be in math class, or for anyone
looking to add a little more math to their day-to-day.</p>

<h2><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44318414-the-dutch-house">The Dutch House</a>: 3.5/5</h2>
<p><em>Ann Patchett</em></p>
<div class="figure align-center">

<p>There's a lot to like and appreciate about this book, but not a lot to love. This is classic Ann
Patchett: a deeply human story about a perfectly normal family that, when you examine closely, isn't
so normal. Her characters and their relationships are so rich, described exclusively through 'show'
and not tell which gives them quirkiness and specificity that's downright delightful. I also love
the span of her book - you get to be with the characters as they develop and change from childhood,
a sort of built-in character growth that isn't forced. I have mixed feelings about how little plot
there was - I liked the smaller mini-stories through the book, and that the focus was so heavily on
the characters, with the entire &quot;plot&quot; spoiled halfway through the book. With all that's to like
about the book though, I didn't find myself deeply invested in the characters. They were fine, but I
wasn't dying to read each next page. I guess that's how many of Patchett's books are, but it still
keeps this one from being a 5 star.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-incomplete-book-of-running-2-5">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38530946-the-incomplete-book-of-running">The Incomplete Book of Running</a>: 2/5</h2>
<p><em>Peter Sagal</em></p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="" src="theme/images/incomplete-book-of-running.jpg" style="height: 300px;" />
</div>
<p>This book was not intended for me. Firstly I've never listened to 'Wait Wait Don't Tell Me', so
while I vaguely knew Peter Sagal I was hardly a fan. Secondly I'm already an avid runner, and the
book was intended for this looking to get into running. The book is part memoir about a person I'm
not invested in (who assumes you <em>are</em> invested in him - you did pick up his book afterall), and
part argument for why you should start running, which...I already am. So, I didn't get a lot out of
it. Also I found out about 2/3 of the way through that he's remarried to someone who is 18 years his
junior, and while I know that love is love and I'm sure she's great or whatever it just creeped me
out and I couldn't keep listening. Call me judgmental, you're not wrong. Anyway, I'm not sure I'd
recommend this book to anyone. I'd say you should read <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6289283-born-to-run">Born to Run</a> instead.</p>

<div class="section" id="pretend-i-m-dead-2-5">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36373223-pretend-i-m-dead?ac=1&amp;from_search=true">Pretend I'm Dead</a>: 2/5</h2>
<p><em>Jen Beagin</em></p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="" src="theme/images/pretend-im-dead.jpg" style="height: 300px;" />
</div>
<p>I learned when reading <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44279110-my-year-of-rest-and-relaxation">My Year of Rest and Relaxation</a> that I'm not particularly drawn to novels
about sadness, or drugs, or poverty, let alone all three in one book. I could only stomach about
half the book before giving up. The reality of the book isn't very pleasant to live in, and while
there are plenty of uncomfortable books that are worth powering through and considering deeply I
didn't feel like I was getting anything out of reading this. That's not entirely true - I think it
gave me some understanding of what it's like to be poor in America, to deal with mental illness and
have no support system. But...then a book I wanted to read more (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42202046-waking-the-witch">Waking the Witch</a>) came in and I
gave up on this one. I'm sure I'm a worse person for it, but also a happier one.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="eight-hundred-grapes-3-5">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23492613-eight-hundred-grapes">Eight Hundred Grapes</a>: 3/5</h2>
<p><em>Laura Dave</em></p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="" src="theme/images/eight-hundred-grapes.jpg" style="height: 300px;" />
</div>
<p>This was definitely a small step up from the last novel of Dave's I read, <em>Hello Sunshine</em>. I
appreciated that the central conflict of the book isn't just &quot;Will she get the guy?&quot;, but was about
her career and direction of her life. The heroine was relatable and imperfect, and the story did a
good job of exploring the messiness and complication of real life without having such a heavy &quot;novel
facade&quot;, which I think tends to skim over those details. Her parents relationship in particular
resonated with me, as it was neither a fairytale nor a nightmare but a regular old marriage, full of
compromise and heartache and love. I doubt I'll remember much about this book a few months from now,
but for a short time it was a good book to escape into.</p>
