<h2>If I Were A Boy</h2>
<p>09.25.2016</p>
<p>Before attending university I was completely unaware of the diversity
problem in STEM. In high school all of my classes were relatively
50-50 in terms of gender, including science and math classes, and I
had never experienced or noticed anyone treating me differently than
my male peers.  My fist computer science class at university was ~5%
femaleÂ¹, and as I started to consume more tech media (ie. <a class="reference external" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker
News</a>) it became clear the Oregon State was not an exception.</p>
<p>Even after 3 years of classes like this, I'm really not sure how to
feel about the dearth of diversity in STEM.  But regardless of the
emotions I cycle through or the discussions I have with people, one
question that frequently gets asked is whether people treat me
differently because I'm a woman,or whether I'm discriminated against.
The answer is yes, of course: it's natural that people treat me
differently because I'm a (very feminine) woman, but more than that I
want to address the skeptical tone people take when they ask if I
experience discrimination.  My intention here isn't to shame people
for their skepticism, compare my experiences to those of others, or
have this be a &quot;Woe is me!&quot; post. But I want my peers to be aware that
I do experience discrimination, and have a variety of negative and
uncomfortable experiences that would likely not have happened, or had
the same negative meaning, if I were a boy.</p>
<div class="section" id="etherpad">
<h2>Etherpad</h2>
<p>We use <a class="reference external" href="http://etherpad.osuosl.org">etherpads</a> to organize events for the <a class="reference external" href="http://lug.oregonstate.edu">Linux Users Group</a>, and
each new user can identify themselves manually on the etherpad.  However
everyone has access to each name input, so a single user can put whatever
they'd like as each person's name.  Since most new users don't know about
this feature, or don't care to put their name in, often one person will
put their own name in each name input, so it looks like there are 10
'Elis' all talking to each other.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="" src="/theme/images/etherpad-identify.png" />
</div>
<p>So, when planning meetings for LUG this term I took the liberty of doing
this, putting my own name in each of the name inputs.  Later that day
I reopened the etherpad to find the following text at the bottom
of the page: &quot;Lucys been a naughty gurl. She gun get fired&quot;.
I'm confident that the note was a very poorly done joke, meant
to be harmless and completely missing the mark. But it was
humiliating nonetheless.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-bus">
<h2>The Bus</h2>
<p>A male colleague and I were on a bus from Corvallis to Portland, and
happened to be the only people on the bus.  Almost a year earlier we
had lightly flirted in our interactions, but we had never done
anything and since that time I had started seriously (and
monogamously) dating my boyfriend. So, the colleague and I were
sitting together, first chatting then watching a movie.  He would
occassionally make uncomfortable comments like &quot;I wouldn't mind seeing
you naked&quot;, but I would just ignore them and forge ahead in the
conversation, thinking them relatively harmless. Then when the movie
started he picked my hand up and put it on his upper thigh. Despite
being only a 1.5 hour ride, it felt like the longest of my life. In
all fairness I could have dealt with it much better: I was stunned and
had no idea what to do, so ended up using the computer as an excuse to
remove my hand then just tried to keep to myself and keep distracted
for the rest of the ride, never telling him how uncomfortable that had
made me or that it wasn't ok with me.  In retrospect, I should have
said something. Then again, it probably shouldn't have happened in the
first place.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-maker-fair">
<h2>The Maker Fair</h2>
<p>I was manning a Lego Robotics booth at the Corvallis Maker Fair.
I had a little demo set up, and spiel about what my organization did, and
spent most of the day showing kids how to program the robots and talking
to very kind parents. As a swarm of kids left the table, one of the event
organizers asked if he could get a short clip of me explaining the demo
and then showing how it worked, and I said sure.  I did the thing, he took
the video, then left with his wife to see other exhibits. A nearby
man who had seen the exchange came up, and after I started giving my spiel
he stopped me mid sentence and said &quot;You know he just wanted your picture, right?&quot;.
Lost for words, I think I just gaped, then turned to someone else and started
helping them with something.  His comment made me so uncomfortable, and
marred what had been a great morning and memory.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-21st-birthday">
<h2>The 21st Birthday</h2>
<p>By now I had graduated from university, but was visiting Corvallis to
see my boyfriend and celebrate his roommate's 21st birthday.  It was a
Friday night, and as we were touring the bars and restaurants of
Corvallis we met a few people who were friends-of-friends. This
resulted in a group of 8-10 people eating at a pizza joint, only some
of whom I knew personally. After long conversations that I had a hard
time contributing to, I found a tiny foothold for myself: &quot;Oh, yeah, I
used to love that mine game...mine stopper?&quot;.  &quot;Minesweeper&quot; my friend
said. Then, a voice down the table from someone I didn't know said &quot;No
worries, it's got a lot of numbers in it&quot;. I hope that he didn't mean
to imply that a game with lots of numbers in it would be hard for me
to remember, enjoy, or be good at. But in the moment it felt like I
was being pushed even further out of a conversation I was already not
a part of, and like that <em>was</em> what he was implying.  I left shortly
after, holding back tears, and was told that I should have just said
&quot;Fuck you&quot; to the guy and carried on.  I shouldn't have let it ruin
the evening, and should have asserted that it wasn't an OK thing to
say.  But why is that burden on me?  Why didn't my friends defend me,
or even notice that I was visibly upset at the comment?  Why didn't
anyone else think it wasn't OK?</p>
<p>Now that I'm working in the real world, I realize what being treated
equally is like. I love my job, and am a respected colleague at my
workplace.  People who have been in the industry since I was born ask
for my opinion, have me review their work, and I never second guess my
standing among them. This makes discrimination that much clearer to
me: each time someone doesn't assume I'm their equal, it stands out.
It stings. In so many ways, I wish I could go back to when I didn't
notice it. When a comment like that could have been totally innocuous.
But it's not, anymore.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-little-things">
<h2>The Little Things</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>09/20/2016</strong>: I walk to work everyday, going down Belmont and
crossing the Morrison Bridge. I usually leave between 6:30 and 7,
when it's definitely light outside and there are lots of other
people walking, biking, and driving the same direction.  I listen to
a variety of books and podcasts, and am literally wearing
clothes appropriate for a professional work environment (not that it
matters, but I just want to set the scene here and provide context).
About half way through my walk a construction truck was stopped at a
red light, and as I waited at the same red light one of the men in
the truck wolf-whistled (loud enough to hear through my headphones),
then the other yelled &quot;Nice ass, honey!&quot;.  I ignored them,
pretending I hadn't heard, but they're comments got weirdly in my
head. &quot;Were these jeans not appropriate?  I didn't even put makeup
on this morning, why are you yelling at me?  Can I melt into the
ground right now?&quot;  I realized that I was blaming myself for what
they had said, and wondering what I could do to avoid it in the
future.  Wear baggier clothes? Maybe I should take the bus?  I
talked to another female co-worker about it once I got to work, and
she helped me feel better about it. It wasn't my fault, it didn't
reflect on me at all, it was just two guys who decided to be
assholes and make comments about me on my walk into work.</li>
<li><strong>09/29/2016</strong>: A female friend and I went to see &quot;The Music of
David Bowie: The Oregon Symphony&quot; at the Schnitz. It was a
<em>wonderful</em> concert, and as we were walking back to my car, we both
had our phones out looking up directions to my friend's apartment. A
man tapped one of us on the shoulder and said &quot;Were you ladies
filming in there? I'm going to have to confiscate your phones.&quot;  We
both looked at each other terrified.  Were you...? No, neither of us
had our phones out at all during the concert. We shook our heads
&quot;No, we didn't do anything&quot;, then he laughed and said &quot;I'm just
kidding, you ladies both look beautiful tonight&quot;.  We speed walked
away, both totally uncomfortable and dreading the long walk to the
car in the dark.</li>
<li><strong>02/24/2017</strong>: In a meeting today the QA team was discussing
changes to our interview process. At one point a coworker was
referring to potential candidates and said &quot;The guy won't get XYZ.
He might not think to do ABC.&quot; and went on to continue referring
potential candidates as exclusively male for the rest of the
meeting. It's such a small thing, and I almost brought it up and
pointed it out, but I know he's not doing it intentionally. But it
does make clear that we unconsciously think of engineers as being
male.</li>
<li><strong>07/02/2017</strong>: I spent the day with my partner and 2 close friends.
Overall it was a wonderful day, but at one point I ate the last
piece of an avocado despite my partner saying he wanted it. In
fairness, I should not have eaten it. But I made a joke about it
(&quot;Never stand between a girl and her avocado&quot; or something), and one
of our friends said &quot;I've found that taking things for granted
doesn't end well&quot;, and proceeded to compare me to his coworkers who
complain about the free food at their office. Not only was this
belittling and alienating, but blatantly disrespectful. Had the
roles been reversed with my partner or friend eating the last piece
and making a joke, I doubt the friend would have said a word. I
failed to gracefully respond in the moment, and before I knew it we
were back to other things. But it's good to know now that this
person doesn't respect me as a peer.</li>
<li><strong>08/02/2017</strong>: Yesterday, my male coworker (we'll call him Doe,
that's not his real name) and I gave a presentation together at DevOps Days
PDX. My email was the one we submitted the proposal to, and the next morning
I had not 1 but 2 emails in my inbox that started &quot;Hello Doe,&quot;, and none
which were addressed to me (or even to both of us). Granted, I think this
could have happened in the reverse as well -- had it been Doe's email, he may
have gotten a number of emails addressed to me after the talk. But at the
same time...that didn't happen.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>My experiences are my own and don't necessarily reflect or represent those
of all women in STEM fields, but I hope they do humanize the diversity
struggle in those industries and highlight the ways in which sexism is
still happening.  It's not all bad: I have always received equal pay for
equal work to my male peers, am respected within the community, and
have never felt that I was denied an opportunity, promotion, or
position because I am a woman. At the same time none of the above
experiences would have happened if I were a boy.</p>

<dl class="docutils">
<dt>1 This number comes from me very unscientifically counting the number</dt>
<dd>of people in class who appeared to be female and asking the professor
how many students total were in the class.  I understand that appearance
is not an indicator of gender, and there's possibly errors in
mis-identifying individuals, particularly if they're not gender binary.
I apologize for this, but the point remains the same: the class was
<em>dominated</em> by male humans</dd>
