<h2>Why I'm Not Afraid of Self-Driving Cars</h2>
<p>02.26.2016</p>
<p>Among the ranks of podcasts NPR creates, one is an aggregated feed of
technical bits from a variety of news podcasts -- basically a curated, audio
Hacker News.  This past week, everyone has been
FREAKING OUT about the WFC fight of the century, Apple vs. FBI, in a
non-stop stream of uninformed (or worse, half-informed) newscasters questioning
whether Apple is doing the right thing by protecting their users privacy*.
However, in the breaths between FREAKING OUT, there were a few bits on
self-driving cars, and whether America is ready for them.  The bit focused
on folks saying they didn't trust self-driving cars</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I'll spare you the drama and to say I side very strongly with Apple, and
if you don't care to read more about the issue you should as well.  Take
it from an engineer.</li>
</ul>
