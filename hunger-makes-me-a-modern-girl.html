<h2>Book Review: Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl</h2>
<p>03.1.2016</p>
<p>I spent the weekend Spring Cleaning my new apartment, accompanied by
this highly anticipated read, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Hunger-Makes-Me-Modern-Girl/dp/1594486638">Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl</a> by
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.carriebrownstein.com/">Carrie Brownstein</a>. Brownstein's memoir of her
time in the band <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sleater-kinney.com/">Sleater-Kinney</a>, this book was raw to the point
of discomfort. Whatever opinions I may have, they're outweighed
by the respect I have for Brownstein's openness, vulnerability, and honesty.
The whole book, beginning to end, is one long intimate passage into
the private lives of herself, her family, and her bandmates, sharing
details I would cringe to tell my own friends, let alone publish
for the world to read. More than anything I'm in awe of her
talent for writing and fearless storytelling.  After the
amazement at her baring-all, though, I had a few other thoughts
on the book.</p>
<p>I went in with few expectations and
scattered knowledge of Carrie Brownstein. I knew from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/">All Songs Considered</a>
that she was a member of Sleater-Kinney, that she had worked briefly
for that podcast, and of course knew about her role in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ifc.com/shows/portlandia">Portlandia</a>.
But I had never listened to Sleater-Kinney's music, much less studied their
past or had any part in the Pacific Northwest punk scene. In hindsight,
doing a little bit of studying before hand would have been helpful --
the book catalogs her experiences before, during, and briefly after
Sleater-Kinney exclusively, and she frequently references bands and
events I had never heard of, despite being so geographically and
temporally close to them.  This was a bug and a feature: knowing so
little made the book more educational, interesting, and worthwhile,
but also in many ways less meaningful or impactful for me personally.
That said, Brownstein includes so much more than just a history of
the band.  Her struggles with anxiety and depression, a variety
of physical conditions including shingles and an allergy to soy,
and hypochondria while touring with a band, are very much relatable
to any who has battled those same battles. She also speaks at length
of coming of age and finding what she wanted to do, of how her parents
own repressed selves affected her childhood, and of other
profound thoughts on the human experience in the modern age, and how
to navigate it.</p>
<p>Overall, &quot;Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl&quot; was an enjoyable
and worthwhile read. Entertaining, insightful, and almost unbearably
honest, I would highly recommend picking this up if you have a chance.</p>
