<h2>Book Review: Sex Object</h2>
<p>10.4.2016</p>
<img alt="" src="/theme/images/sex-object.png" style="height: 400px;">
<p>I picked this book up off of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.powells.com/bestsellers">Powell's &quot;New + Recommended&quot;</a> list, and
had little background on <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Valenti">Jessica Valenti</a>.  I knew it was branded
as 'Feminist', whatever that means, but didn't know much else going
in.  Unlike many books I finish, my feelings about it are complex.</p>
<p>The book is a chronicle of terrible experiences she has had around
gender, from getting cat-called, to being in abusive relationships,
to getting death threats on the internet.  While I identified with a
number of her experiences and appreciated that her book made me
think more about how I'm treated, I finished it feeling sad and very
much tired of talking about gender.  There's no call to action or
even real cause-effect to her stories. It's just the stories as they
happened, told like the script for a movie: all facts, with little
&quot;Here's how this <em>should</em> have happened&quot; or &quot;Here's what you, as a
man, woman, or child, can do&quot; or even &quot;Here's how I wish I had
reacted&quot;.  I find so often that when <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.lucywyman.me/boy.html">men don't treat me with
respect</a> I have no idea how to react in the moment, and wish that
she had provided some guidance or thoughts there.  In the end, she
was only telling me things I already knew with no revelatory
thoughts.  Her book didn't change how I see her, how I see the
world, how I react to various situations, or how I understand gender
or being a woman.  Perhaps she was targeting those who don't even
realize what misogyny looks like, or how common aggression is, but
honestly those people are not the same people who are going to be
reading her book. The people who are going to read her book are
people like me, who know and recognize that they are frequently
treated like sex objects.  In the end, I feel sorry for how
extremely unpleasant many of her experiences are, and that there's
little or nothing she and I can do about it, but I didn't need to
read this book to understand that.</p>
<p>If you're looking for other great reads by great women, I'd
recommend picking up Amy Schumer's <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29405093-the-girl-with-the-lower-back-tattoo">The Girl with the Lower Back
Tattoo</a>, Jenny Lawson's <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23848559-furiously-happy">Furiously Happy</a>, or Mindy Kaling's <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10335308-is-everyone-hanging-out-without-me">Is
Everyone Hanging Out Without Me</a>.</p>
