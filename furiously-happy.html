<h2>Book Review: Furiously Happy</h2>
<p>04.3.2016</p>

<p>For those who don't know, <a class="reference external" href="http://thebloggess.com/furiously-happy/">Furiously Happy</a> is about the life of
author <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Lawson">Jenny Lawson</a>, and her struggle with a variety of disorders
including depression and anxiety.  I'm not really sure if it's a
memoir or autobiography or neither, but you can think of it as a
series of blog posts about things that happen in her life, and her
thoughts.  It is <em>hilarious</em>, and poignant, and helps people who
don't have disorders understand what's it like to have a disorder
(I think....I don't have a disorder, so can't confirm this, but I
definitely <em>feel</em> like I have a better understanding of them now).
She describes what it's like when they get especially bad in very
relatable ways, using experiences that most humans have had, and
without asking for pity.  It's also not just about feels and sad things --
she narrates her life with silliness and humor, and many of the experiences
themselves are hilarious as well. From waking up to find her arms are
asleep, to having her daughter congratulate her on making friends,
Lawson talks about experiences we've all had without fear
of self-deprecation.  &quot;Furiously Happy&quot; is a fun and thought-provoking
read.  As a side note, I realize this whole post is very effusive and
only has nice things to say about the book. I honestly have nothing bad to say about it. I expected it
to be a quick and funny read, and got <em>way</em> more than I bargained
for, which is just about all you can ask of a book. As a sub-side-note,
I highly recommend the audio-book version as well. It's narrated by
the author, has several &quot;extra&quot; little bits in it, and Lawson's narration
definitely adds a lot to the experience of consuming the book.</p>
