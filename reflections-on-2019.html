<h2>Reflections on 2019</h2>
<p>12.29.2019</p>
<div class='parent'>
  <img alt="" src="/theme/images/2019.jpg" style="height: 400px;">
</div>
<p>Boy, time has a way of stretching itself out. I know most people chorus &quot;Time
flies!&quot; when reflecting on the year, but for me time might be a snail. It's
slow and steady, it mosies by, it enjoys the scenery. It leaves a slimy trail
over everything - ok, it's not a perfect metaphor.</p>
<p>January 2019 feels like it was 10 years ago. I can't believe I was
<em>living in Seattle</em> then - and thought we'd be staying there for the forseeable
future. I can't believe I hadn't started going to Orange Theory yet, or met any
of the friends I've made this year. I wasn't ENGAGED! Or
knee-deep in wedding planning. I know I sound like a <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.lucywyman.me/reflections-on-2018.html">broken record</a>, but each
year my life looks completely different from the previous year. It's exciting,
and I love that I get to savor my time, that it elongates. There are so many
moments that feel important this year, which I think is why time feels slow. I
want to maintain that going forward, especially after the wedding.</p>
<div class="section" id="orange-theory">
<h2>Orange Theory</h2>
<p>One of my <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.lucywyman.me/19-for-2019.html">19 for 2019</a> items was to try a new workout class. Previously I had
been rising at 4 am, trudging to Planet Fitness, and hanging out on an
elliptical for 30 minutes while watching HGTV. It was fine, enjoyable even, but
not inspiring. Fitness has always been a big part of my life, and I wanted to
find a friends I could work out with, as well as a better work out. We tried
Orange Theory during one of their promotions in late January and never looked
back. It's expensive, but worth every penny in how much happier it makes me. We
originally went to the West Seattle location, which got us hooked, but I fell
in love when we started going to the SE Portland location. I've made close
friends there, and it's such a relief to touch base with them most mornings.
The workout makes me happy day-to-day, but my OTF friends add richness and
meaning to my life. Definitely one of the best parts of my year!</p>

<div class="section" id="hawaii">
<h2>Hawaii</h2>
<div class="padded figure">

</div>
<div class="padded figure">
<img alt="" src="theme/images/hawaii-2019-2.jpg" style="width: 330px;" />
</div>
<p>The best money I ever spent was flying out of Seattle 4 days early to avoid the
snow. I called Eli the day after I landed and he casually mentioned that THE
POWER WAS OUT and I knew I had made right decision as I took another sip of my
pina colada and looked out over the ocean. It was a cool 75Â° in Honolulu that
day. What I loved most about Hawaii is that there are no landmarks or museums
you must see - the whole bit is to just relax and enjoy the sun. I spent 10
days just walking up and down the beach, listening to audiobooks or the ocean,
and enjoying being ankle deep in sand instead of snow.  We did a few gorgeous
hikes, and maybe saw a movie? But the thrill was in being there.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="moving-to-portland">
<h2>Moving to Portland</h2>
<p>After nearly a year of searching, Eli landed a new job at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cloudbolt.io/">Cloud Bolt</a>, a
Portland tech startup located in Revolution Hall of all places. We moved to an
apartment that was located within walking distance of both my and Eli's offices
(<em>so lucky</em> our offices are that close together), and have loved living there.
I really enjoyed <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.lucywyman.me/a-year-in-seattle.html">living in Seattle</a>, particularly living with friends and
experiencing a new city. But I also deeply missed our friends and family in
Portland, and missed working from the Puppet office there. I don't regret
moving to Seattle for a moment, but I'm also so glad we came back. This last
year has felt like coming home, and has meant we get to spend more quality time
with our families, have started a DnD campaign with my good friends from high
school, and that we feel at home.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="no-car">
<h2>No Car</h2>
<p>When we moved to Portland we also &quot;gave our car away&quot;....to Eli's mom. This was
something we'd been thinking about for a while, for a number of reasons: cars
are expensive, cars contribute to pollution, they disconnect you from your
surrounding environment, and they're a hassle to maintain. Plus we knew living
in Portland, we'd likely be able to live car-free relatively easily. We chose
our apartment location to accomodate living without a car (including putting
some of the money we'd save each month towards a higher rent), and haven't
looked back.</p>
<p>Prepare yourselves for the anti-car rave. I love not having a car. Mostly I
love that I never have to worry about it. I never have to fix the windshield
wipers, or get gas, or store it, or think about someone breaking into it. I
never have to drive it and risk hitting someone, or being hit. I also love
biking and bussing - because we live centrally it rarely takes much longer than
driving, and is a more engaging and interesting way to travel. I can feel the
wind in my hair and smell the trees in the summer, and can read or watch the
city go by on the bus. We're lucky to live in a city and have a lifestyle that
enable us to live without a car, and it's worth noting we Lyft and carpool a
few times each month. But it's so much cheaper, greener, and just <em>happier</em>
than having a car.</p>

<div class="section" id="budapest">
<h2>Budapest</h2>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="/theme/images/budapest-2019.jpg" style="height: 400px;" />
</div>
<p>I got to go to Budapest, Hungary this summer for Puppet's <a class="reference external" href="https://puppet.com/community/events/puppet-contributor-summit/">Contributor
Summit</a>, which was a great time. I didn't get to spend as much time exploring
Budapest as I might have liked, given I was there for work, but it's so
rewarding to connect with Puppet enthusiasts and my European colleagues. I met
some of the nicest, funniest people on that trip and hope I can reconnect with
some folks in the future!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summer-of-fun">
<h2>Summer of Fun</h2>
<div class="padded figure">
<img alt="" src="/theme/images/boyscout.jpg" style="height: 400px;" />
</div>
<div class="padded figure">
<img alt="" src="/theme/images/rose-garden.jpg" style="height: 400px;" />
</div>
<p>This isn't a single event, but we had a lot of fun this summer. I was energized
by being back in Portland with friends, and was excited to reacquiant myself
with my hometown. We floated the river, and went to the Rose Garden, we went to
the State Fair and the Oregon Country Fair. I went to the Pride Parade, then
got a tattoo, then went to the Opera, in one day. I love summer, and this was
one of the best ones yet!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="engagement">
<h2>Engagement</h2>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="/theme/images/engaged.jpg" style="height: 400px;" />
</div>
<p>And the big news, we got engaged! We talked about getting married early in our
relationship, to make sure it was something we both wanted. We've known we
would eventually get married for a long time, and since moving to Portland had
been talking more seriously about it. We wanted to do it now while so many
friends and family were in or close to Portland, and we just felt ready. So,
Eli popping the question was hardly a surprise. In fact...we had already booked
our venue and date when he did ð. Needless to say I'm over the moon, and am so
excited to marry Eli. He brings so much joy to my life, and is so supportive
and kind. I love that he makes me laugh even when I'm in a bad mood, and shares
so many of my values. And honestly, I also love that we share the same views on
a lot of important things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We're very liberal, politically</li>
<li>We don't believe in God, or religions</li>
<li>We're frugal, and spend according to our values (mostly)</li>
<li>We're about the same level of messy, and share housework easily</li>
<li>We love dogs</li>
<li>We want kids eventually, but value our jobs right now</li>
<li>We even both work in tech, and talk in detail about our work. He deeply understands how terrible writing XML is.</li>
<li>We don't like to fight, and are good at talking things out.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think you can have a successful relationship without these commonalities, but
it's <em>so</em> much easier (and works for us!) to have the same views on all of
these and more. It's something we often take for granted, but is a lot of what
I love about Eli.</p>
<p>We're very excited about getting married in 2020, and celebrating with our friends and family!</p>
