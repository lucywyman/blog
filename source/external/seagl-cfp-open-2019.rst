**Note:** The SeaGL leadership team does weekly proposal review/feedback
sessions as well as email proposal review and feedback. Please bring
us your talk ideas and proposals and we’ll help you polish them before
you submit them to the CFP. See the `Help and mentoring for your
proposals`_ section for more information.

What's better than open source software? Open call for papers!

You may be thinking "I don't know if I'm ready to give a talk. I'm
just a student / community member / manager / llama - people don't
want to hear what I have to say". Poppycock! We want to hear all of your
ooey-gooey open source thoughts.

Amplifying diverse voices and creating a welcoming space for everyone
are core values for SeaGL. We welcome speakers of **all backgrounds and
levels of experience** - especially first-time speakers and folx new
to tech. If you’re excited about Free/Libre/Open technologies or
communities, then we want to hear from you!

Because we’re a community-focused event based in Seattle, we’re
particularly interested in hearing from new and experienced speakers
from the Seattle and Pacific Northwest region, but we welcome
proposals from anyone no matter where you’re based.

Here’s what we cover in this CFP announcement. We know it’s rather a
lot, so you can click to jump to the section you need (but we
encourage you to read it all through at least once).
