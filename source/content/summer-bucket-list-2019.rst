Wow, I *epically* failed my `spring bucket list`_. I barely did one of
the items - and even then, only because of this list and without
particular joy. In my meager defense it's been a busy spring, with an
interstate move and reconnecting with all my Portland people. And
actually, even with my bucket list languishing, taunting me from it's
display on my blog, it was a fantastic season. Portland fills me with
so much joy, since abandoning my car I've gotten outside to appreciate
and relish spring more than in past years. The season has been lush
and bright and happy.

Now that we're settled I am coming for you summer! We're gonna eat
tacos. We're gonna do some hikes. We're gonna see friends, and go to
concerts, and have barbecues, and drink on a rooftop, and fucking live
it up. Watermelon. Every. Damn. Day.

--Go berry picking--

--Visit the `Rose Garden`_--

--Go to a concert-- (I'm counting my surprise Opera show)

See an outdoor movie or Shakespeare in the Park

--Get a plant for our patio--

--Take a class-- (I learned how to repair a flat bike tire)

Book a trip to Colorado to see friends

Ok that's plenty given my track record so far this year has
not been stellar. I'm also hoping to make it to a Timbers or Thorns
game, go swimming, try some new foods, climb some tall things, and see
plenty of my family and friends. What are your plans for the summer?
