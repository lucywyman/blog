`How Not To Be Wrong`_ by Jordan Ellenburg is a book
describing how math is used (and misused) in everyday 
life. From the lottery, to elections, to predicting 
the weather and the existence of God, Ellenburg
explains how to develop a better intuition for all the number
and percentages swirling around the news and media. It 
focuses mostly on statistics, but also delves into 
geometry + algebra (and their relationship), multi-dimensional
spaces and linear algebra, and number theory. As a 
"relatively mathy" person, I definitely felt like I got a 
lot out of it,though I'm not entirely sure I would recommend
it to less mathematically-inclined readers. Although I believe
it was intended for that audience, and is definitely an 
accessible view into high mathematics, it's also a book
about math. My point being: don't expect to be spoon fed 
math and magically become knowledgable. Like with all knowledge,
you've gotta put in a little work. But it's *totally worth it*.

Some favorite quotes:
---------------------

* "And you can't deny that there are aspects of the natural world - I'm 
  thinking pandas here - that seem more likely to have resulted from grudging
  bureaucratic compromise than from the mind of an all knowing deity with 
  total creative control"
* "For those who are willing to adopt a view of probability as degree of belief 
  Bayes theorem can be seen not as a mere mathematical equation, but as a form 
  of mathematically flavored advice"
