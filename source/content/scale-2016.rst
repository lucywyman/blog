Day 0:
------

We pulled up to the venue at about 5:30 Friday night, T-90 minutes to Ignite 
talks.  I chugged a chocolate milk from the "gift store", ran through my
slides one last time, got dinner with the bosses, and found myself on a stage.

The Ignite Talks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Deb Nicholson, **The Foss Awakens**. How collaboration and mentoring
  are a force for good, told with Star Wars images. Grade-A speaker, definitely
  delivered. Great way to start the evening.
* Gilbert Standen, **Building Oracle on LXC**. He lost me at "Oracle".
* Me. **Rocking the House**.  But seriously, people laughed at my jokes, 
  I got high-fived, it went better than expected.
* Dave Nielsen, **Redis**. Kind of informative, kind of boring.
* Emily Dunham, **Where's the Cloud**. Much like Deb, Emily is a veteran 
  speaker and it shows. Funny, informative, ended on a pun.
* Don Marti, **Web ads**. I would have appreciated it more if I was less sleepy
  I think.
* Justin King, **Choosing a Framework for your project**. Knowledgable and 
  well spoken, it's pretty great to watch a not-adult give a talk.  They have 
  great perspective.
* Corey Quinn: **Docker Must Die: Heresy in the Church of Docker**. So, so
  funny. Dude is a master. 

After some good laughs, I headed back up to my room, realized how 
overwhelmingly underprepared I was for my talk, finished up my slides and hit
the hay.

Day 1:
------

Woke up early and got breakfast at this adorable bakery, `Euro Pane`_.
Ran through the talk once for good measure, then headed over to the Key Note,
by Mark Shuttleworth. Honestly, it was pretty much a sales pitch, and I 
wasn't really into it. But at least I didn't feel bad leaving early. I headed
over to my room, set everything up, then walked around to get out the nerves.

My Talk
~~~~~~~

`Modifying the Kernel: A How-to`_
Not my best, not my worst. I got across the information I wanted to, and got 
lots of positive feedback after the talk and throughout the day. More than 
anything, I'm relieved that it's over and I can cross it off of my 
to-do list.

Lunch
~~~~~

We had guacamole, made tableside. It was *bomb*.

Keila Banks, Automated Teen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I was really excited for this talk, and was a little let down. Between mic 
issues, some nerves, and being a little out of touch with the conference, 
I didn't get what I wanted to out of the talk.  All of that said, I have a 
lot of respect for Keila giving a talk to such a big room, and for getting up
there in the first place. I'm excited to see what she does in the future, and 
hope to see her at other Open Source conferences soon.

Justin Mayer, Essential Linux Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This was pretty nearly the perfect talk.  I learned about a lot of valuable
tools, including changes you can make to your SSH configs, creating SSL 
certificates with Let's Encrypt, HSTS, CSP, and other tools to make my 
computer and websites safer.  In Justin's words, "Think of the children".

You can check out his slides at https://justinmayer.com/talks/server-security/#/

Brandon Philips, Etcd
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Also a great talk. Brandon is obviously a well-practiced speaker who
seemed very comfortable on stage.  He's also incredibly knowledgeable, and it 
was clear that this talk was only skimming the surface of what he knows on 
the subject of etcd. I also didn't know very much about etcd or CoreOS going 
in to the talk -- I even thought the d was for daemon :p -- so stood to get 
a lot out of it. And I did!  

You can see some of the demos he did at https://github.com/philips/hacks/tree/master/etcd-demos, 
or learn more about CoreOS at https://coreos.com/

Day 2:
------

This morning was absolutely *beautiful* in Pasadena.  I got to walk around 
for a while before everyone else woke up, and soak in some Sunday Morning 
magic. I don't know. There's something about it.

Keynote: Sarah Sharp on Diversity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

She said a lot of really important things, but they're also things that everyone
has heard before.  She knows her stuff, and seems very passionate, but that 
keynote isn't going to change anything.  Call me a cynic, but from the two 
guys behind me asking "Why should minorities get a stipend just for getting an
internship?" to ethnic homogeneity of the audience, I don't hold much hope 
for tech companies realizing how important diversity of their workforce is 
any time soon.

Randal Schwartz, Intro to Dart
