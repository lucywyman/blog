What a summer! As we say hello to crisp mornings, plaid scarves, and
cinnamon-spiced treats, I wanted to take a moment to review my `Summer
Bucket List`_ and create a new bucket list for Fall. Like my summer
list, this isn't a to-do list. There are no have-to's or should's
here. But it's something to get me excited for the coming season!

.. _Summer Bucket List: http://blog.lucywyman.me/summer-bucket-list-2017

☑  Attend a sports ball game

☐  Visit a pumpkin patch

☑  Make a `sweet potato pie`_

☑  Go apple picking

☑  Enjoy a `pumpkin stout`_ (I also loved `this cider`_)

☑  Send notes to friends and family for Thanksgiving

☑  Dress up for Halloween (we're thinking of going as Baby and Debora from Baby Driver)

☑  Cook tofu instead of meat at least once a week

☑  Run the `Portland Half Marathon`_
