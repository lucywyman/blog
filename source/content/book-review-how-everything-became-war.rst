`How Everything Became War, and the Military Became Everything`_ might
be the best book I read this year. The military has never been a part
of the cultures I grew up in, so my knowledge and awareness of
what the military is, how it's run, and what it does is basically
nothing. I couldn't even tell you all of the branches, or the
distinctions between them. With this context in mind, this book held
incredible insight for me. `Rosa Brooks`_, a former reporter for the
Pentagon, explains not only what the military does but why it does it,
how it does it, what impacts those actions have. She's able to support
her claims with ample evidence as well as personal stories, and
defends her statements and positions from every possible angle. She
also looks at various parts of the military under a microscope,
explaining the history of this unit or that organization and where
they are today, and also looks very broadly at the military as a whole
complex system and how that system is working. She asks questions like
"What does it mean to be a solider, both historically and today? How
has that role changed in the last 2000 years and in the last decade?"
and "Why is our military a proxy for diplomacy, nation building, and
relief effort?". She explores the relationship between soldiers and
civilians, and how that too has changed dramatically over time.
I came away from the book with a greater
understanding of our military's history, it's present state, and how
it came to be the way that it is. I know more about what the military
does and why it does it, and the pros and cons of having the military
partake in all of the actions that it does.
