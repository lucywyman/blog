We've officially `moved to Portland`_! I couldn't be happier to be
back in my hometown - I missed my family and friends, I missed going
into the office, and I missed the city itself. Eli and I have had a
great time rediscovering the city and our neighborhood - so far we've
gone to `Cascade Brewery`_, `Afuri`_, `Smith Teamaker`_, and `Books
with Pictures`_. We haven't even made it back to my beloved `Los
Gorditos`_ yet. Eli is loving his new job, and Luna has loved going in
to the Puppet office. We're looking forward to a summer full of fun
activities! In the meantime I've had a lot of time for reading (or
listening) now that I'm commuting, so here's what I've been reading:

`America for Beginners`_
------------------------

This was an endearing, heartwarming, unexpectedly melancholy novel. It
follows an Indian widow - rid of her isolating, emotionally abusive
husband - on her search for her gay son in America. The adventure of
course goes sideways, and is full of cultural conflict, examining
prejudices, and realizing that we're all similar. An uplifting read -
but be prepared with tissues at the end!

`I Remember Nothing`_
---------------------
*Nora Ephron*

My latest Nora Ephron, I found this one was hard to connect to. It's
all about her experience of aging, and I felt the generational
disconnect. I'd love to pick this up again when I'm 40 or 50, but for
now it just felt melancholy and foreign, and made me afraid of getting
older.

`Mirror, Shoulder, Signal`_
---------------------------
*Dorothe Nors*

This one didn't quite do it for me either. It's about a 40-something
Danish woman struggling to move on from a rough childhood. It's sparse
on details though, and I found Sonja's anxieties and murky past hard
to read about. It's simultaneous distressing and not terribly
interesting, and felt weirdly empty of both plot and characters. In
the end I moved on to more enjoyable reads.

`Swearing is Good for You`_
---------------------------

Like a long-form podcast, this was a super interesting and well
written book! It looks at swearing from every angle - why we do it,
how it's changed over time, how it affects our brains. Everyone swears
or has opinions on cussing, so it's definitely relevant to your life
and makes for great conversations with just about anyone. It's
scientific yet accessible - at one point the author even cites her own
paper! Some of my favorite learnings are that monkeys will create new
words from the words they know which resulted in them calling radishes
"cry food", and that calling someone's mother a "das Schwein" (pig) in
Germany is one of the most offensive curses (like, actually *do not
say it*).  If you listen to a lot of science podcasts or like
nonfiction this is a great read!

`A Life Less Throwaway`_
------------------------

Coming off of `Happy City`_ I wanted to know more about reducing the
waste I produce - not just in trash, but in buying things I don't need
or use. This ended up being too much preaching for me. Despite the
authors helpful, actionable exercises, the well researched and planned
solutions to the social problem of buying too much, I found I wasn't
getting very much out of it. It was geared toward someone who was more
skeptical and 'early' in their own-less journey, and honestly I also
just didn't love the narrator of the audiobook.

`The Lido`_
-----------

This book was solidly fine. It's way too nostalgic, and heavy-handed
in prescribing the kind of society we should live in. If you love
reading articles about how millennials and cellphones are ruining
everything, this is a great book for you!

I don't. That said, the characters are endearing and the plot is
somewhat interesting. It's got a YA vibe in that every personality and
event is heavily simplified (in fact it's more YA than a lot of the YA
books I read...), and the whole book felt one-dimensional. But if
you're looking for an easy, mostly-uplifting read, this'll do the
trick :)

`Not the Girls You're Looking For`_
-----------------------------------
*Aminah Mae Safi*

I have mixed feelings about this one. It was more solidly YA than many
of the "YA" novels I read, and it reminded me of all the best and
worst parts of high school. Lulu is a biracial Arab-American Muslim teen
(her mom is a white American Catholic, her dad an Iraqi Muslim) living
in Texas, and it was interesting (and heartbreaking) to read about her
experiences of racism and struggle with her own cultural identity. She
has a wonderful and dramatic group of friends who have their own
struggles - one Hispanic, one lesbian, one with helicopter parents -
and while their fights felt petty they were also realistically high
school. I love the perspective this book gave me and the complexity of
the characters, if not the complexity of their boy problems.

`Tell Me Three Things`_
-----------------------

Another true YA read, this had a similar vibe to the previous one -
heavy on the boy troubles, but also on the well-written characters
with interesting struggles. 'Tell Me Three Things' follows Jessie after
her mom dies, and her dad moves her from Chicago to LA to live with
his new wife (about 2 years after her mom dies). While the plot itself
is predictable Jessie's grief and coping with the loss of her mom is
palpable, and every character is dynamic and well-written.

`Calling Me Home`_
------------------
*Julie Kibler*

I LOVED this book. After a lot of so-so books it's so refreshing to
read a book that reminds you why you love to read. The book starts in
modern day when 90-something Isabelle asks her close friend and hair
dresser Dorrie to drive her to a funeral in Cincinnati from their home
in east Texas. Isabelle tells Dorrie about falling in love with a black
man in 1939 in Kentucky, in parallel talking about Dorrie's own modern
life as a black single mom raising 2 kids and dating. The characters
were so rich in this book, and before I knew it I felt so invested in
knowing what would happen next. I laughed, I cried, I gained so much
appreciation for the privilege I have as a white woman living in
modern day. My first 5-star in a while.

`The Dirty Book Club`_

This was some lovely lighter fare while I travelled to Budapest for
work. It follows four women who, through a hilarious and unlikely
series of events, find themselves in a book club together despite
knowing very little about each other. From there the real antics
start: accidental affairs (the affair part is accidental, not the
sex), a bathtub falling through the ceiling, party favor vibrators,
and a big secret. I liked the complex female friendships in this - how
the 4 don't always get along but find that their lives are better
together than apart, and how in the end they're there for each other.
This is a fun and exciting beach read!
