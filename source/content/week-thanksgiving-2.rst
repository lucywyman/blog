This is the second post of my `Thanksgiving Week`_ series. If you
haven't already, I'd recommend reading the `introduction post`_ first!

You guys. You. Guys. I can't believe how lucky I am to have such good
friends. These aren't friends that I take selfies with and tag
"Besties!", these are people who have seen me ugly cry, who were
*there* for me when times got tough, who stuck it out with me even
when I wasn't the nicest person or greatest friend. They let me sit
with them at lunch when no one else would. They intervened when I was
dating someone who wasn't nice to me. They shared their crayons with
me, went to summer camps with me, spent countless christmases and
thanksgivings and easters with me, and have *loved me unconditionally*
for decades now. I'm so grateful to have

Sasha
Isadora
Mackenzie
Daniel
Sean
and Eli

in my life, filling it with meaning and joy.
