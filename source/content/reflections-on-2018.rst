I keep waiting for life to settle down, for `the days to feel long and
the years to feel short`_, but just like `2016`_ and `2017`_ 2018 felt
momentous. My life now is *so different* than it was a year ago, both
in the day-to-day and the memories I've collected in the last year.

Eli and I moved to Seattle, along with 2 friends. We live in a house!
In a different city, and a different state! And TOGETHER! After being
long distance for 2 *eternities* (er, years) I am so happy to get to
see my beloved every day - to cook together, and walk the dog, and
watch tv, and just be.

We also went to `Japan`_ for 3 weeks! The trip was incredible - we stayed
in a house with a rotating cast of 12 friends, and had so much fun
exploring Tokyo. We loved how navigable the city was, how culturally
and structurally different it was from the US, and how *big* it was.
We hope to go back sometime in the near future!

I can't believe this is *third* on the list of Big Things that
happened this year, but we also adopted a dog. Her name is Luna, and
she is *so dumb* but is a great little dog, and brings so much joy and
laughter into our lives. She's loving, and excited when we get home,
and loves loves loves attention.

I also:

* Saw my best friend get married
* Got to go to `Amsterdam`_ for work
* Read `over 60`_ books
* Spoke at conferences in Pasadena CA, Salt Lake city UT, Portland OR, Seattle WA, Vancouver BC, and Bellingham WA

Phew. It's been a year. If 2017 was the year of
waiting, I'd say 2018 was the year I became an adult. While a lot
of these travels and changes are important and have changed who I am,
moving in with Eli to a new city and state has made me feel grown-up
in a way I hadn't before. Maybe it's because Eli was still in school,
or because I still lived close to my parents, but this was the first
year I felt truly on my own and at the helm of my life. I got my oil
changed! I went to the DMV to get a Washington license! I feed our dog
every morning! While my increase in responsibilities is minimal, being
able to offer friends the guest room at our house and taking care of
Luna have made me feel more adult than I did living alone in my tiny
studio. Eli and I have created a small family in a new place, and
we've reached a routine and stability that feels mature.

At the beginning of the year I deemed 'fun' my word of 2018. I felt,
and still feel, that I'm growing up too fast and not celebrating my
youth while I am young. In the day-to-day I still feel like I'm an
80-year-old in a 23-year-old body, but in reflecting on the year I did
a lot of really fun things. I got to travel to incredible places,
stayed out late to see incredible shows, went to cider fests and
trivia nights and music festivals, and spent so much time with my
friends. While still panicked about my fleeting youth I also made the
most of my free time this year, and found joy in all the things we did
and the people we did them with. I have no regrets about how I spent
my time, and am enjoying this season of life: working a job I love,
living with people I love, and exploring the world.

Next Year
---------

Looking ahead, I'm excited about what 2019 will bring for us. We're
still in a phase of life with a lot of fluctuations, and our plans for
next year are uncertain at best. In a way I love this just-in-time
planning though - it makes me feel busy and lively and like I can go
anywhere at anytime. My phrase for next year is **get curious**. I
feel I've lost my sense of wonder at the world, my desire to know more
and to move towards things that scare me. This year, in both work and
life, I want to discover new things and develop a greater sense of
curiosity for all the wonderful things there are in the world. What
does that taste like? How does that work? I want to try to ask more
questions, and then go about answering them. With that comes some risk - I 
think in general I *don't* ask those questions because I'm afraid
of failure. Failure to answer them, failure to do something I've
never done because I'll be bad at it. I want to face that fear, and
take the risk, and be ok with failing or looking silly or not liking
something.

So, about 2 days away from 2019, here's to a fantastic 2018 and an
even better 2019! Cheers!
