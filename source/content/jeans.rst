For at least the last decade, my relationship with jeans would make
Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton seem stable.  They're too tight
around my butt and the tops of my thighs, too loose around my waist
and hips, make my legs look like sausages, or *constantly* riding
too low.  I pretty much gave up on pants altogether in high school,
and only begrudgingly eased my way back in with leggings during
those too-busy college days.

BUT. BUTT. That's all changed. I found a pair that work really well
for my body at a Goodwill, and bought 3 pairs from the retailer
a week later.  `The jeans`_ are skinny jeans from American Eagle
of all places, and for me (29" waist 42" hips) a size 12 fits
perfectly.  I definitely have to wear them with `a belt`_, but there's
a lot to love about them:

1. They fit my butt and thighs well, providing support without being
   too tight.
2. I like that they're a little loose around the ankle without being
   flared.
3. They're sturdy but soft, and just a little bit stretchy.
