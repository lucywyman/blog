Hello! How are you? How are things? I've been travelling for work a
lot for the past month - a blessing and a curse - which has meant I
get to see a lot of wonderful humans I care for and don't see very
often. 

I've unknowingly been on a books-by-women-about-women kick
this summer - I didn't even notice until scrolling through my library
history. And honestly I'm really into it. This has been a pretty good
run of high-quality reads, most of them the right balance of fun and
meaningful. I've talked before about "vegetable books" and "candy
books", but I think many of these reads can probably be called "fruit
books": sweet, and secretly good for you. And often brightly colored
on the outside.

`When Katie Met Cassidy`_
-------------------------
*Camille Perri*

I think I fell in love with both of the heroines in this book. They're
such rich, complex, layered characters I felt like I knew them in real
life. Camille Perri is a master at describing emotional responses,
details in interactions, and wardrobes, in a way that paints such a
complete picture of Katie and Cassidy's relationship. I loved how she
bent gendered stereotypes so effortlessly: of *course* Katie was going
to fall for Cassidy, of *course* they were meant to be together. A
fantastic modern love story.

`The Bucket List`_

Is it possible for there to be a hilarious book about cancer? Well, if
it is, I can't imagine it gets better than `The Bucket List`_. The
protagonist is a sarcastic young woman who so closely mirrors my own
struggle with balancing work and feminism and life and womanhood it's
like reading my diary. What I love about this book is the voice and
style of the character, the way she's not just contending with having
the BRCA 1 gene mutation but also *life* as a 20-something in New
York. Highly, highly recommended reading for the right mix of fun and
thought-provoking.

`To All the Boys I've Loved Before`_

I know everyone is already buzzing about `To All the Boys I've Loved
Before`_ since Netflix made it `a movie`_, but I'm here to throw in
another "You should read this!".  It's more YA than fiction or
romance, but is so sweet and (for a 23 year old like me) nostalgic.
It's a wonderful teenage romance, with all the angst and drama and
heightened emotions you'd expect but without the jerky boys and
vampires. `This GQ article`_ sums it up: "At last, with the help of
Netflix, we have our new type: the wholesome man."

`Meet the Frugalwoods`_
-----------------------
*Elizabeth Willard Thames*

If you know anything about the `financial independence / retire early
(FIRE)`_ community, it's probably `Mr. Money Mustache`_. And if you
read MMM, you're probably either 1. A bro who identifies strongly with
him and who loves to brag to your friends about how you haven't eaten at a
restaurant for 3 years or 2. A normal person who was intimidated away
from the notion of saving for retirement. But it doesn't have to be
this way! `Frugalwoods`_ is a fantastic FIRE blog written by the
eloquent and sensible Elizabeth Willard Thames, where she prescribes a
more balanced and kind approach to frugality. I love that Elizabeth
acknowledges the privilege inherent in elective frugality, that she
preaches spending based on your *values* not on miserly living, and
that she is never judgemental or condescending. I love her blog, and
her book is really just a consolidated and long version of that. I
highly highly highly recommend either, whichever suits your fancy, no
matter where your finances are or what your goals are.

`Eat Pray Love`_
----------------
*Elizabeth Gilbert*

Reread for the third or fourth time, Elizabeth Gilbert's writing is my
comfort food. Her writing style is so warm and expressive, filled with
delicious metaphors and rich descriptions. It's like seeing the world
with entirely new eyes, and inspires me to look closer at myself and
my environment. I love all her memoirish books - `Committed`_ and `Big
Magic`_ are equally wonderful and revelatory - and love coming back to
them at different points throughout my life. A book is never the same
when you come back to it, and each time I notice a new passage or
insight that I somehow missed the first 4 times through. Rather than
recommending you read EPL, though, I recommend picking up a favorite
read from a few years ago. What book do you keep coming back to, or
take comfort in reading?

`A Fall of Marigolds`_
----------------------

I'll be honest, this book didn't resonate with me that much. I found
one of the main characters - who narrates most of the book - to be
wishy-washy and limp. I didn't like her, though perhaps I wasn't
supposed to like her? Regardless the book was at least good enough to
finish, seemed to resonate with many other people, and while I didn't
*love* the characters it was well-written and clever. If you like
historical fiction, or stories set in New York, this is for you!
