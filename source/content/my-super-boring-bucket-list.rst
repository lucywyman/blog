My Super Boring Bucket List

I read an article today about Bucket Lists that included a comments
section, and was surprised by two patterns in people's bucket lists:

* The Northern Lights seemed to be the most frequent single item. I
  have no idea what would compel anyone to stand in freezing weather
  in the middle of the night, but it will certainly take more than
  lights to get me there.
* Approximately 95% of bucket list items were places to travel to.
  While I would have guessed travel to appear on most lists, I was
  surprised that people didn't really seem to think of a bucket list
  as much more than a travel check-list. While visiting places seems
  cool, I guess I wished there were more creative ideas for things to
  do or learn or make? That sounds so pretentious and judgey, but I
  guess for this post I will accept my role as pretentious and judgey
  narrator.

But! It was a great read, because it inspired me to write my own
bucket list, which I later realized reveals how in my heart of
hearts, my deepest, truest self is a total square. So! Here is my very
boring bucket list:

☑   Become a Senior Software Engineer
☑  Get a doggo
☐  Become financially independent (read: not need to work)
☑   Speak a little Spanish every day
☐  Bake cinnamon rolls (or maybe just eat a lot of cinnamon rolls...)
☐  Visit Boston
☐  Get married and have a family
☐  Be an extra in a film or a contestant on a game show
☐  Fly first class

This honestly feels more like a list of long-term goals or a checklist
than a fun list of adventures (with a few exceptions, like eating a
lot of cinnamon rolls). Initially I was panicked by my apparent lack
of ambition or wanderlust. Didn't I want more from my one life than
this? Was being an extra in a movie really the most out-there, fun
thing I could think to do? But after reflecting more on my own list as
well as other common list items, I think this list is the best
reflection of me and the life I want to live. Of course I want to
travel more, and do more than is on this list, but I don't want it to
be prescriptive, or to feel as though I'm just checking things off a
list rather than pursuing new and exciting adventures. I want to leave
room for my list to change, knowing that my life and self are likely
to change. And honestly, I don't really want to see the Northern
Lights or run a marathon or go sky diving, all common bucket list
items that I can honestly say I have no desire to experience. So this
is it: a relatively short and boring list of things I want to do
before I die. #YOLO.
