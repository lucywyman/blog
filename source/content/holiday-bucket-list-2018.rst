Thanksgiving has come and gone, which means the HOLIDAY SEASON has
started. Christmas is a confusing time - like a lot of millennials I
have found memories of Christmas with my family, and love the lights
and the tree and the ritual of it. On the other hand I've outgrown the
temptations of materialism; I don't *need* anything, and am not sure
what my friends and family want. But to say I love the spirit of
Christmas sounds weirdly religious, which I'm emphatically not. So...I
love un-holy spirit of Christmas, probably for nostalgic reasons -
there it is, caveats and all.

I'm most excited about the closeness I feel with friends and family
during this time of year, and the chance to spend more time together.
There are many things I want to do with loved ones this year, some old
family traditions and some exciting new things. 

☑  Volunteer (I ended up volunteering at `PodCon 2`_)
☑  Bake cookies (I'm thinking `orange and clove`_, but ended up making `matcha cookies`_)
☐  Visit Santa
☑  Get a Christmas tree and decorate it
☑  Attend or host at least one Christmas party in a fancy dress
☑  Go to one live theater performance or concert (we got tickets to `Christmastown`_
☑  Watch a classic Christmas movie (I love 'Elf')
☑  Walk down `Peacock Lane`_

Truth time: I know this is a super long list of activities, but I
BELIEVE in the magic of Christmas.
