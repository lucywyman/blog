I know, I know. It's too early.  But...is it? I feel like I go through
this every year: it's always too early to start thinking about the
holidays until December 20th, and then I'm scrambling to find or make
good gifts for my family and friends. I don't know about you, but I do
*not* work best under that kind of pressure. I also don't have the
foresight to do what my mom does and just shop for presents
year-round, finding things she thinks people will like. We can't all
be planners.

So, November 4th seems like a good enough in between. And what better
gift is there to give than a good story?  Whether your
recipient is an enthusiastic reader or hasn't picked up a book in
years, I think there's something for everyone at the local book store.
Here are my recommendations, no matter who you're giving to!

For the Non-Reader
------------------

This is definitely the hardest person to buy a book for. But with
the rise of audiobooks, coloring books, and graphic novels
I think you can find something for everyone! Let's break it down.

Audiobooks
~~~~~~~~~~

I can't overstate how much I love audiobooks. I spend so much time
walking, running, doing laundry, cooking, stretching, *doing*, and
being able to spend that time with a book in my ears has been
life changing. I use `Overdrive`_ (way better than Audible!), which
connects to your local library and lets you download e-books and
audiobooks to any device, including *your phone*. **For free**.
Fancy, right? Here's how you can turn that into a non-reader gift:

* **Set it up**. Installing the app, connecting it to the library,
  downloading books, connecting the phone to the
  car...it can be a lot. Getting everything ready to go so your loved
  one just has to press 'play' could be the push they need to remember
  how much they love books!
* **CDs**. I know I know I know. But again, sometimes setting it all
  up on the phone is just too much.  Give your loved one a book on
  tape they can play in the car. Especially perfect if you've got an
  upcoming road trip!
* **Your own recommendations**. Sharing a book together is a beautiful
  thing. Seeing a novel through someone else's eyes can open up new
  perspectives, interpretations, and meaning you may not have seen.
  And you get to share a thing you love with a person you love.

Coloring Books
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You've seen them.  You've thought "Really? Adult coloring books?".
Your friend's mom has one. And now, your mom can have one too!
Coloring is meditative, methodic, excellent to keep your hands busy
while watching TV.  Here are a few that look neat:

* `The Secret Garden`_. Kind of the OG coloring book.
* `Color Me Calm`_
* `Pride and Prejudice: A Coloring Classic`_

Graphic Novels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not just for kids! Graphic novels have grown into beautifully
illustrated, intricate stories with as much character development,
plot, and meaning as any other book.  Here are a few that are really
stunning:

* `Blankets`_ by Craig Thompson. This was definitely the first graphic
  novel I read where I realized what a graphic novel could be. 
* `The Sculptor`_ by Scott McCloud. Per the recommendation of my SO, a
  graphic novel fan.

For the History Buff
--------------------

* `White Trash: The 400-Year Untold History of Class in America`_ by
  Nancy Isenberg. America is hardly classless,
  anybody-can-be-anything country  we like to think it is. This book
  recounts the history of the mistreatment of the poor, and discusses
  the surprising origins of elitism in the US (hint: owning land used
  to be a BFD).
* `HRC`_ by Amie Parnes and Jonathan Allen. You may as well start
  reading up on the life and times of our future president ;) It
  focuses on her time as Secretary of State, but I think it has great
  insight into how she makes decisions, what motivates her, and is
  relatively objective and accurate.

For the Girl Boss
-----------------

By far the hardest category to narrow down, it's hard to go wrong with
any of these titles for the feminist reader (woops, sorry, I
misspelled 'everyone') in your life:

* `Shrill`_ by Lindy West. So many 'aha' moments in this book.
  Lindy West names and confronts some uncomfortable truths in this
  book.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll become a better human.
  Really you should just get it for yourself as a present.
* `The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo`_ by Amy Schumer. An incredibly
  intimate look into who Amy Schumer is, and how she came to be the
  person she is today. 
* `Wild`_ by Cheryl Strayed. I know this book was trendier last year,
  but if your loved one didn't get a chance to read it it's well worth
  coming back to.
* `I am Malala`_ by Malala Yousafzai. If you're not sure who she is,
  you *definitely* need to read this.  If you know her, you know why
  you need to read this.
* `Yes, Please`_ by Amy Pohler. The life and times of an amazing
  woman, featuring some great advice we could all use.

For the Mathlete
----------------

These are ordered by difficulty + level of math, from most advanced to
most accessible.

* `Gödel, Escher, Bach`_ by Douglas Hofstadter is a mind-bending, brain-exploding math +
  philosophy book. This is perfect your friend who just started grad
  school.
* `Love and Math`_ by Edward Frenkel is just a great math book.  Part memoir, part
  linear algebra, Edward Frenkel discusses how he came to love math,
  what he endured to be part of the mathematics community, and what he
  spent his life researching and discovering. 
* `How Not to Be Wrong`_ by Jordan Ellenberg is for the armchair mathematician. It's a
  critical analysis of how we approach problems, and common data
  analytics methods.  More "How to think about this real-world issue" than
  "Here's how Andrew Wiles solved the Fermat Theorem".  My favorite
  quote is:
  *"And you can't deny that there are aspects of the natural
  world - I'm thinking pandas here - that seem more likely to have
  resulted from grudging bureaucratic compromise than from the mind of
  an all knowing deity with total creative control"*

For the CSI Fan
---------------
I've unexpectedly started reading mysteries recently. I
didn't even know what I was getting myself into, but here are a few
juicy ones I've enjoyed.

* `I'm Thinking of Ending Things`_ by Iain Reid. A short but
  satisfying thriller. 
* `All is Not Forgotten`_ by Wendy Walker. As a mystery noob, I'm *so*
  invested in this book. Is it the son?  The pot dealer? I was hooked,
  and so satisfied by the ending.
* `The Girl on the Train`_ by Paula Hawkins. Honestly, when I first read it I
  thought it was a little meh. I had a hard time connecting to the
  main character, or caring about what happened to her. But with all
  the hype + the movie, I may have to give it another read.

For the Friend with a BB8 Pillow
--------------------------------

AKA Sci-Fi.

* `Ready Player One`_ by Ernest Cline is a totally accessible and fun
  story. It's a classic hero's tale, with 80's geek and gamer culture
  mixed in. Highly recommend for readers of any age.
* `Use of Weapons`_ by Iain Banks is by far my favorite sci-fi book.
  Great characters, an excellent ending, compelling plot, and very
  interesting premise. Highly, highly recommend for all readers
* `The Lathe of Heaven`_ by Ursula K. LeGuin is a solid, satisfying
  sci-fi adventure.

.. _Ready Player One: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9969571-ready-player-one

For the People Person
---------------------

This section is really just an excuse to recommend `When Breath
Becomes Air`_.

* `When Breath Becomes Air`_ by Paul Kalanathi is the heartbreaking
  story of a young neurosurgeon diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer.
  Intimate with the American healthcare system as both a doctor and a
  patient, this book has fascinating insights and thoughts around the
  ultimate question: *What makes life worth living?*
* `The Audacity of Hope`_ by Barack Obama, for when you need to
  revitalize your faith in our country's politicians.

And that's all she wrote, folks! I hope you have a wonderful holiday
season, surrounded by family and friends you love ♥
