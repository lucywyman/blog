I got married this summer, and in thinking about what it means to spend your life with someone I've
been thinking a lot about how much just *being there* matters. I think at startups especially, and
Puppet in particular which has so many long-time employees, reminiscing and reinforcing those
experiences we were there for is so subconcious and common it's a conversation we easily fall into
at lunches. This blog post is more of a 'journal entry', with myself as the primary audience, but I
wanted to publish it because I know some people shared these experiences with me and I think
recounting them here may have some value for them too. I tried to make the post somewhat navigable
and chronological so you can try to find the things that are meaningful to you.

## 2014

I remember going to the OSCON after party in 2014, people crushed into the RiverTec office.
Everything seemed so Silicon Valley, so bright and expensive. I remember there were cupcakes in
every room (remember when cupcakes were A Thing?), and by 9 PM it was like the pit at a concert,
crammed with people. I remember my friends and I spilling out the front door around midnight, sober
because we weren't 21 but reveling in the Gatsby of that party.

## 2015

I remember Maggie Dreyer and I started our internships on the same day, and got to meet with Luke at
the end of the first week. We each got to ask a question, and I asked what the one thing he could
change would be. "I wouldn't make Puppet Open Source" he said, and my Linux heart sank. To be honest
I don't remember what Maggie asked, but maybe she does?

I remember Hambone.

I remember going out for lunch every Friday, usually to E-San Thai, and sometimes to the DC
Vegetarian Cart. I forget whose last day it was, but when someone left there were like 24 of us who
wanted to go out, and we basically had the whole top floor of E-San to ourselves.

To be continued...
