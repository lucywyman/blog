Hello, fair reader! This is my personal guide to the beautiful city of
Portland. Whether you're local and looking to try something new, or
visiting and wondering where the good stuff is, this is a list of my
favorite places in the city. Adventure on!

Places
~~~~~~

`Powell's Books`_
-----------------

In the digital age, as book stores around the world close their doors,
Powell's remains a thriving hub of literature.  Even if you haven't
picked up a book in years, Powell's will remind you of the power books
have over us, and make you thirsty for knowledge.  You'll be wandering
aimlessly, not sure what there is for you there, then find yourself
thinking 'I bet that vegetarian cookbook would help me cook at home
more instead of getting takeout', or 'Oooo, I haven't read Phillip K.
Dick in years. I used to love his books', and the game is over. The
book worm, occasional beach reader, skeptical technophile,
wonder-filled child, and dormant literature lover will inevitably find
themselves drawn to one of Powell's 1 million books and fall in love
all over again.  Even if you just come for the corgi-socks, it's worth
the visit!

`Rose Test Garden`
------------------

The International Rose Test Garden is one of the most traditionally
beautiful places in Portland.  With several football fields of roses
and several hundred million types of roses, it's easy to lose all
sense of time and space amidst the fragrance and brilliance of the
Rose Test Garden. All kidding aside, the RTG is a must during the
summer months when roses are in full bloom.

`Serra`_
--------

That's right, marijuana is legal in Oregon now, which has resulted in
some of the *cutest* and friendliest shops popping up around town. I
think there are a few things that make marijuana shops super great:
1. They're combatting some pretty harsh cultural taboos. Pot is still frequently seen as "bad" or seedy (see my parents reaction when they read this post), so the best marijuana stores combat that by being very well lit, open spaces that are *beautifully* designed. The staff are often very friendly and knowledgeable too, so you don't need to feel uncool for asking a million questions or leave without knowing what you're putting in your body. 
2. Everything is local, by necessity. Because marijuana isn't legal in other states it can't cross state lines, even if it's legal in both of those states (ie. Oregon and Washington). This means you're by default supporting amazing local businesses who are often supplying 100% locally made and extremely high quality products.

I love Serra because it epitomizes both of these qualities. All of
their shops are in gorgeous old buildings, and are staffed with folks
who will stand there for *literally hours* answering all your
questions about strains and chemicals and neurology and side effects.
And honestly you guys, I like consuming (not smoking) marijuana *so*
much more than drinking. Beyond a glass or two of wine alcohol really
doesn't agree with my system, and has ruined a few nights and
mornings. Marijuana doesn't have those terrible physical side
effects, and provides equally enjoyable inebriation in the right
doses. If you're in town and haven't tried it yet, I highly (ha)
recommend!

`Bagdad Theater`_
-----------------

`McMenamin's`_ is more than a brewery, but an eclectic variety of
refurbished vintage buildings providing places for communities to
gather. The `Bagdad Theater`_ is one such place. Located at the heart of
Hawthorne, the Bagdad is the perfect "Portland" place for dinner, a
movie, or both! When my SO was living in Portland over the summer we
would go there almost every Saturday, get a large order of tater tots,
and enjoy the movies they screened there. It's a staple of our lives,
and a staple of Portland culture.

`Ground Kontrol`_
-----------------

Most big cities have classic arcades, and `Ground Kontrol`_ is ours.
With about a million pinball machines, classics like DDR and
Ms.Pacman, and newer games like Killer Queen, GK has something for
everyone. Bring your quarters and forget your troubles for a few
hours.

Food
~~~~

`E-San Thai`_
-------------

The food may just be OK, but E-San has a special place in my heart.
My co-workers and I often go there for lunch on Fridays, and I have so
many fond memories of us squeezing 10-18 people into their loft,
laughing together and enjoying a meal. I always get the same thing
(Pad See Ew with Carrots) and have never tired of it! It may seem
blase at first, but take your time at E-San. Admire the old wood and
sturdy construction, the elaborate decorations, the scratches in the
tables and floor that let you know this place is *lived in* and
*loved*.

`DC Vegetarian`_
----------------

Portland is also known for it's `Food Carts`_, and while I can't say
I've tried enough to tell you what that best in the city are, I will
tell you that whenever I go to a food cart for lunch it is always to
DC Vegetarian on 3rd and Alder. Their vegetarian and vegan
sandwiches are better than their meaty counterparts, and my
go-to meal is just $5.50, the cheapest lunch you can get downtown at
lunch hour. I highly recommend the vegan BLT, with avocado of course!

`Blue Star Donuts`_
-------------------

It's my duty as a native Portlander to tell you that `VooDoo donuts`_ are
entirely overrated, and that if you really want the Portland Donut
Experience you absolutely must go to Blue Star. With classic and
exotic flavors, Blue Star donuts are fresh and doughy, not too sweet,
and 100% satisfying. My personal favorite is the Blueberry Bourbon
Basil, but you'll just have to try them all to see which is your
favorite.

`Cacao`_
--------

Drinkable. Chocolate. Need I say more? Cacao is a super fancy
chocolate place, with a few locations throughout Portland. They have
all the high-quality chocolate your heart could desire, fancy people
who use words like "earthy" and "floral" to tell you about it, and did
I mention the drinkable chocolate?  Warning: you will be consistently
disappointed in hot chocolate after going here.
