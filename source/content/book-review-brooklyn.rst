All I knew when I picked this book up was that 
it was made into a movie, and had something to do with a 
young woman, the early 20th century, and probably 
Brooklyn, NY.  Honestly, even that was too much: 
I spent much of my time reading it trying to figure out 
why someone would choose to turn *this* book into a film
and came away disappointed.  It was blasé, and while I 
don't want to diminish the experience of immigrants 
to NY in the early 1900s there was nothing unique, 
clever, eye-opening, or otherwise remarkable about the novel.
I liked the main character well enough, but found that 
in the end I didn't care what happened to her or any of 
the other characters. The main character Eilis and her 
sister Rose feel very much like female characters written by 
a man. You can very clearly see the lens through which 
he views them, the brush strokes he uses to create them,
and that makes them seem very unreal.  They feel more 
like what you would get if you asked your well-meaning 
grandfather to describe his first love interest than 
real women, and without the connection to the characters
I found myself struggling to hold on to anything in the 
novel.  I appreciate that Tóibín wrote a novel that centered 
on strong female characters, and that such a novel 
could be turned into an award-winning film. But before 
we congratulate ourselves on appreciating a novel about 
a woman who travels alone to America, goes to college 
and works, and chats with her sister and female roommates,
let's consider that Eilis probably experienced a lot of 
fear, racism, sexism, uncertainty, and hardship that 
is generally glossed over. Overall I was underwhelmed,
and wouldn't recommend it if you've got other books 
on your list to read.
