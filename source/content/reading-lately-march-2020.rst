`Work Optional`_: 5/5

I've been reading Hester's financial independence blog `Our Next Life`_ for years now, so knew I'd
like her book. Her voice is practical and compassionate, and her financial advice has just the right
amount of detail to be informative but not overwhelming. `Work Optional`_ is more of a workbook than
a novel, giving the reader exercises, algorithms, and concrete next steps to reach (or define) their
financial goals. It's your nosy aunt in book form: what *do* you want to do with your life? The
questions are gentle and guiding, and don't require strict answers - they're only there to be
considered, and to help you. The rest of the book is information on financial principles to help you
decide what's right for you. Do you need a health savings account? Should you be saving up for a
house? For example, I realized that planting more trees and providing better infrastructure for
biking are what I find most fulfilling, and that I should have health insurance coverage *along
with* my HSA. No matter where you are financially I think you'll find this book useful!

`Love Her or Lose Her`_: 5/5

Yowza! This book is so hot it might burn ðŸ˜‰. `Love Her or Lose Her`_ has an unusual romantic
premise: a husband and wife have lost touch, and work together to repair their tattered
relationship. There's so much to love about this book. Like so many modern couples they weren't
considering divorce for dramatic or scandalous reasons, but just because they had stopped
communicating and drifted apart. Unlike most couples, Dominic and Rosie are willing to put in the
hard work to fall back in love, documented throughout the book. Their sexual chemistry is *so hot*,
and their vulnerability and development throughout the book are heartwarming and engaging. The
supporting cast is also fantastic, and I appreciate that these characters have full and vibrant
lives and ambitions outside of their relationship that makes them feel like actual people. Did I
mention that Rosie is a woman of color who opens her own restaurant? 10/10 must read!

`Committed`: 4/5

I started my fourth read of *Committed* in anticipation of getting married this summer, and while
reading it came to realize our wedding would not be happening this year. I'm not sure if maturity or
quarantine (or both) changed my view of Liz Gilbert, but this time through *Committed* rang just a
little more hollow. Maybe it's because I know now she's divorced Felipe, or because the prose reads
a bit more melodramatic than it used to. Maybe it's because I was *so excited* to get married while
Liz was dreading it, which felt sad. Whatever the case may be, my shiny love for this book dulled
the tiniest bit on this reading.

`Love from A to Z`: 4/5
-----------------------
*S.K. Ali*

This was a sweet and substantial modern teen romance. Adam and Zayneb could not be more different,
but they share important things in common: navigating being faithful Muslim teenagers in the US and
UK, the importance of family, and their love for Doha, Qatar, where the book is set. Like any
romance, I judged this book mostly on the richness of its characters, who were richer than a fudgy
brownie. I also loved the setting and perspective though, and the chance to better understand the
hate and prejudice Muslims contend with every day in America. It was heartbreaking. On the flip side
it was wonderful to read a book set in the Middle East, to better understand the culture and be
transported to where being Muslim is normal. *Love from A to Z* was a fabulous teen romance with
depth.

`Not the Girl You Marry`_: 3/5
------------------------------

A mostly forgettable retelling of 'How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days'. Not bad, not good, just ok.

`The Starless Sea`_: 2/5
------------------------

This book wasn't bad, it just wasn't for me. The grandeur of the narration felt overdone, the
symbology seemed random and meaningless, and the plot was hard to keep track of. I think this is
probably a great book that I just couldn't appreciate.

`We Ride Upon Sticks`: 2/5
--------------------------

After reading *Waking the Witch* I've been consuming all the witchy content I can get my hands on.
My excitement about *We Ride Upon Sticks* quickly flamed out though. The book opens by introducing
an entire field-hockey team, 11 teens in total, and keeping track of all the characters
and their relations is harder than keeping up with the Kardashians. "Wait, which one is the Claw
again?", "Who is Becca?", and "Is Julie on the team or just a classmate?" pretty well summarizes my
thoughts while reading this book. The premise sounded so fun, I just wish I could have gotten past
the character overload and exposition to enjoy it.

`So We Can Glow`_: 1/5
----------------------

From the narrow-minded opening poem to the confusing, abstract prose, I made it through barely half
of this short-story collection before giving up. I had such high hopes for this highly-rated
female-focused collection, but was completely turned off by the first piece and completely lost for
the rest. Maybe I just didn't get it?
