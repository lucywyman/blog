Inspired by `Joy the Baker`_, I'm making a Summer Bucket List. I don't like the
idea of have-to's or should's, but I do like the idea of heading into the
summer with answers to the question "What should we do on this beautiful day?".
Many of these are time-honored traditions in my family, so this is more of a
reminder to partake than an aspirational list. Nonetheless, it bears writing
and checking in. Here's what we're planning on doing:

1. Take a `Salsa class`_ (I'm already signed up!) x
2. Go to `Oaks Park`_
3. Attend the `Oregon State Fair`_ (and maybe submit a baked good...)
4. Go berry picking 
5. Go to Shakespeare in the Park in Seattle
6. Have a barbecue x
7. Go to trivia night
8. Go to `Last Thursday`_
9. Bake some bread. Yeast scares me, and I want to get over it.

That's all! Short. Sweet. Doable. Makin' the most of those summer nights.
