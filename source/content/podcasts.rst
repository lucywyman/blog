The goal of this post is not to enumerate the top 10 podcasts that you
already listen to, but to tell you about some lesser-known podcasts that I
*love*. In no particular order:

* `Oh No Ross and Carrie`_ -- the show where they don't just report on fringe science, spirituality, and claims of the paranormal, but take part themselves! Honestly, whether you enjoy hearing about UFO conferences and acupuncture or not, Ross and Carrie are 2 of the loveliest people you'll listen to. They're who I listen to when I've had a particularly stressful day, and need a few deep breaths of fresh air.
* `More Perfect`_, the podcast about the Supreme Court, by Radio Lab. 
* `Young House Love Has A Podcast`_. I'm honestly not very 'into' interior
  design or home stuff, but I love this couples' banter and their
  relationship. In it for the laughs, with some tips about lighting on
  the side :)
* `The Mystery Show`_. Starlee Kine, who you've definitely
  heard on This American Life (?), solves mysteries that can't be
  solved online. These aren't the "Who was that guy in that movie?"
  questions, but questions like "There's one photo of Britney Spears
  holding a book that only sold 100 copies. How did she get a hold of
  it?" kind of questions. It may sound like a strange and unlikely
  premise, but Starlee executes it *perfectly*, and has definitely
  mastered storytelling.  She's also a delightful narrator, and her
  conversations with people are among the most interesting parts of
  the show. She's so interested in the lives of the people she talks
  to, and even without the mystery part just listening to her interact
  with other humans is inspiring.  All in all, one of the best podcast
  finds of the last year.  It's still pretty new, so catch up while
  you can!
* `Reply All`_. Hosted by PJ Vogt (pronounced "vote") and 
  Alex Goldman, Reply All is a show about the internet.  With
  top-notch banter and interesting topics, I've learned a lot from
  Reply All (mostly about twitter, but also about who invented email
  and how terrorists communicate) and laughed out loud in very public
  places.  Even if you're not a "techie" Reply All will probably float
  your boat.  Try a few episodes, then write me a thank you note.
  You're welcome.
* `2 Dope Queens`_. A new comedy podcast, 2 Dope Queens 
  is live comedy hosted by Phoebe Robinson and Jessica Williams. It's
  a nice break from the more serious podcasts, and as a comedy-world
  newbie I find myself laughing out loud multiple times during each
  episode.  Whether you already have a favorite comedy podcast or not,
  I would highly recommend giving 2DQ a try (obviously, it's on this
  list).
* `Dear Sugar Radio`_. DSR is one of my newer finds, and I've fallen
  in love.  Hosted by Cheryl Strayed and Steve Almond, DSR cover
  universal topics like infidelity, lying, and other struggles we all
  experience by reading and answering letters from listeners. I grew
  up listening to Dr. Laura with my mom, and have seen the light!
  There is a better way! And this podcast is it. Like, imagine Dr.
  Laura hosted by nice and reasonable people instead of mean | crazy |
  racist people.  It's honey in my life.
* `How To Do Everything`_. This show is just a way better version of 
  Stuff You Should Know.  This podcast is the Mecca of banter, the
  banter that every duo aspires to, the kind of banter that
  *inspires*.  They also cover all types of questions, calling experts
  to answer questions like whether dolphins sleep, if wasps can
  recognize each other, and how to do arm-farts.
* `Pod Save America`_. Former speech writers for the Obama administration
  discuss current political events and interview prominent political
  figures. A nice breath of fresh, democratic air during troubling times.
* `KEXP Music That Matters`_. Spotify Discovery Weekly not doing it
  for you?  Each week they put out a curated playlist centered on a
  theme, and the music ranges from punk to hard rock to folk to pop to
  country and beyond.  Some are great, some aren't, but it's worth
  wading through the rough stuff to find the gems. They also tend to
  focus on artists local to the PNW, which means it's a great way for
  me to find shows playing in the area.

Other Podcasts I Listen To That You Probably Do Too:
These are in the order from favorite to least favorite, though if 
I didn't like any of them I just wouldn't listen to them.

* `My Favorite Murder`_
* `Every Little Thing`_
* `Dear Hank and John`_
* `RadioLab`_
* `This American Life`_
* `All Songs Considered`_
* `Planet Money`_
