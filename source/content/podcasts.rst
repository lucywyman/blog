The goal of this post is not to enumerate the top 10 podcasts that you already
listen to, but to tell you about some lesser-known podcasts that I *love*.  

* `The Mystery Show`_. Starlee Kine, who you've definitely
  heard on This American Life (?), solves mysteries that can't be solved
  online. These aren't the "Who was that guy in that movie?" questions, but
  questions like "There's one photo of Britney Spears holding a book that only
  sold 100 copies. How did she get a hold of it?" kind of questions. It may
  sound like a strange and unlikely premise, but Starlee executes it
  *perfectly*, and has definitely mastered storytelling.  She's also a
  delightful narrator, and her conversations with people are among the most
  interesting parts of the show. She's so interested in the lives of the people
  she talks to, and even without the mystery part just listening to her
  interact with other humans is inspiring.  All in all, one of the best podcast
  finds of the last year.  It's still pretty new, so catch up while you can!
* `Reply All`_. Hosted by PJ Vogt (pronounced "vote") and 
  Alex Goldman, Reply All is a show about the internet.  With top-notch banter
  and interesting topics, I've learned a lot from Reply All (mostly about
  twitter, but also about who invented email and how terrorists communicate)
  and laughed out loud in very public places.  Even if you're not a "techie"
  Reply All will probably float your boat.  Try a few episodes, then write me a
  thank you note. You're welcome.
* `2 Dope Queens`_. A new comedy podcast, 2 Dope Queens 
  is live comedy hosted by Phoebe Robinson and Jessica Williams. It's a nice
  break from the more serious podcasts, and as a comedy-world newbie I find
  myself laughing out loud multiple times during each episode.  Whether you
  already have a favorite comedy podcast or not, I would highly recommend
  giving 2DQ a try (obviously, it's on this list).
* `Myths and Legends`_. Hosted by a guy named Jason, the about page
  says it best: "This is a weekly podcast telling legendary stories as closely
  to the originals as possible. Some are incredibly popular stories you think
  you know, but with surprising origins. Others are stories that might be new
  to you, but are definitely worth a listen." Jason weaves in his own analysis
  and comments into his unique telling of each story, and the final product is
  a highly entertaining, interesting, and educational 30-minute show.  
* `Dear Sugar Radio`_. DSR is one of my newer finds, and I've fallen in love.
  Hosted by Cheryl Strayed and Steve Almond, DSR cover universal topics like 
  infidelity, lying, and other struggles we all experience by reading and answering
  letters from listeners. I grew up listening to Dr. Laura with my mom, and 
  have seen the light! There is a better way! And this podcast is it. Like, 
  imagine Dr. Laura hosted by nice and reasonable people instead of mean | crazy | 
  racist people.  It's honey in my life.
* `How To Do Everything`_. This show is just a way better version of 
  Stuff You Should Know.  This podcast is the Mecca of banter, the 
  banter that every duo aspires to, the kind of banter that *inspires*.
  They also cover all types of questions, calling experts to answer 
  questions like whether dolphins sleep, if wasps can recognize each other,
  and how to do arm-farts.
* `The Jess Lively Show`_.  I've already written about this in my `favorite things post`_,
  but I'll say it here again: Jess Lively's Show has changed my life!  I move 
  through the world with so much more intention and purpose, have discovered 
  values I didn't even know I had, and am generally heartened and inspired by
  her and her guests. 
* `KEXP Music That Matters`_. Spotify Discovery Weekly not doing it for you?
  Each week they put out a curated playlist centered on a theme, and the music 
  ranges from punk to hard rock to folk to pop to country and beyond.  Some 
  are great, some aren't, but it's worth wading through the rough stuff 
  to find the gems. They also tend to focus on artists local to the PNW, 
  which means it's a great way for me to find shows playing in the area.

Other Podcasts I Listen To That You Probably Do Too:
These are in the order from favorite to least favorite, though if 
I didn't like any of them I just wouldn't listen to them.

* `This American Life`_
* `All Songs Considered`_
* `Planet Money`_
* `RadioLab`_
* `Love + Radio`_
* `Freakonomics Radio`_
