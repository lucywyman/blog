I've always loved to run. It helps me clear my mind, makes my body
feel good, and that endorphin rush just can't be beat. However, since
I typically run early in the morning and listen to murder podcasts I
opt to use the elliptical at the gym in the mornings in place of
running. That said, this playlist is definitely applicable to whatever
cardio you're doing: running, elliptical, even biking! I have these in
a `spotify playlist`_ (which gets updated frequently as I get bored of
songs), and generally just hit 'shuffle', but you could definitely
construct a more structured workout if you'd like. Anywho, finding
tempo songs that I like to workout to is a hard task, and I wanted to
provide my own list of songs that work for me and my pace (~9 minute
miles). Enjoy!
