With so many applications out there, it's difficult to discern which are 
valuable, usable, and do what you expect them to.  So, for the sake 
of those like me, here are some of the applications I have found 
particularly useful or entertaining. I should also mention that these are 
all free and available on Android.

#. `Overdrive`_: You can connect overdrive to local libraries and checkout 
   books to read or listen to on mobile. I use it to download and listen to
   audiobooks, and honestly went from reading 0 books/year to about 1/week. 
   It's completely changed my life, and made the mundane moments like doing
   laundry or walking to class more entertaining.
#. `AntennaPod`_: Similar to Overdrive, this app brings you great listening
   material in a different form: podcasts.  It has lots of fancy features now
   like adjustable playback speed, automatic deletion once you've listened 
   to an episode, and turning off if you fall asleep.   
#. `Shuttle`_: This is just a music player I'm happy with. If you're happy
   with your music player, I wouldn't worry about it.
#. `Acorns`_: The idea here is that it rounds up any debit/credit card purchases
   you make to the next dollar, invests the money, and then you have access
   to it whenver you need it, and it can continue to grow if you don't. 
#. `Bandsintown`_: You've probably heard of this one, but if not, it's a great
   way to find shows in your city.
#. `Heads up`_: This a fun "We're waiting for something and need to pass
   the time" app. It's especially great with kids.
#. `Mint`_: I use this mostly to set and maintain budgets. You need to give it
   some very personal banking information, so if you're not into that this isn't
   for you, but if you are I've found it very useful. You can even see your
   credit score on it, which is always good to know!
#. `Duolingo`_: You've more than likely already heard of this, but if not
   it's an addictive, gamified way of learning new languages.
#. `One Today`_: A super easy way to make one-time donations to charity.
