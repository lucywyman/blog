Like most books, I picked this one up with no prior knowledge of it's
contents (probably off of `Powell's`_ `New + Recommended`_ list). I
was pleasantly surprised to find a modern retelling of `Pride and
Prejudice`_! `Eligible`_ is the delightful and familiar tale of Lizzy
Bennet, her family, and Mrs.Bennet's quest to get *any* of her 5
daughters married to a man of means. What I loved about Eligible was
that the author stayed very true to the characters while modernizing
them seamlessly. Jane is sensible and pragmatic, Mrs.Bennet is
exasperated and a little manipulative, Lydia and Kitty are thick as
thieves and a little wild, and Mary is awkward and unaware. Avid P&P
fans (ahem, Mackenzie Broderick) may hold a more critical eye to the
novel, but a pleb like me who has only read P&P twice will no doubt
enjoy the classic tale of women, ambitions, and marriage, told in a
modern setting.
