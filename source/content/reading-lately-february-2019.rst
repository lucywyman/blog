Oof. February was a literary *slump*. It felt like each book I picked
up was worse than the last. I tried reading `Lake Success`_, `May the
Best Man Win`_, `Girls in White Dresses`_, and `Walking to Listen`_
before finally making it all the way through `Laura and Emma`_ (which
was honestly just okay).

Despite some truly terrible reads, February was a wonderful month!
Well, mostly our `trip to Hawaii`_ was wonderful. The rest of the
month was spent hoping it wouldn't snow then trapped inside by the
snow. I'm ready to move to LA. It's fine. Here are the few books I
actually made it through this month!

`Royally Matched`_

After reading `A Princess in Theory`_ last month, this was a
disappointing return to typical romance novels. Based on the modern
royal family, the book was utterly predictable and I didn't love
either of the protagonists. Can't say I'd recommend it, but I didn't
have anything better to read and it was a quick.

`Dietland`_

I have really mixed feelings about this book. Having struggled with
anxiety about my body since I was a teenager I thought that a
body-positive read would be good for me. In some ways it was - it's a
fantastically feminist read about learning to love yourself and accept
yourself, including the gross, teary-eyed, hard struggle it takes to
get there. But when the feminism turns violent, and the
self-acceptance gets extreme, the books kind of lost me. I found it
emotional, and confusing, and wasn't sure whether I loved the message
or whether the message was that things can only change through
rejecting society and violence. It was definitely interesting food for
thought, and worth reading.

`Laura and Emma`_

I powered through this after a drought of good books, and liked it
more by the end than I did in the beginning. It's about a single
mother raising her daughter in blue-blood New York City through the
80's and 90's, and was charming but not a *must read*. I thought I
would identify with Laura and her progressive values more than I did,
and while she was empowering and self-reliant and imperfect, I didn't
feel compelled to know what happened to her. I liked Emma as a
character a lot more, and enjoyed how her personality changed as she
aged. Overall, I think this was a great book that just didn't resonate
with me as much as I wanted it to, but I think it may resonate with
others.

`The Immortalists`_

FINALLY, in the last days of the month, I found a book to remind me
why I love to read. This novel opens in 1969 when 4 siblings visit a
fortune teller in their neighborhood, who is rumored to be able to
tell you the day you'll die. The rest of the book follows each of the
siblings, and how the prediction affects them and their lives. I loved
how different each of the siblings is, and their various takes on the
prediction. Each character is slightly romantic and very vivid - they
felt more like people you knew than characters in a book.  It's not
quite 5 stars, but I chewed through this thick book in 3 days and
can't recommend it enough.

I know March is typically "In like a lion and out like a lamb", but
spring came early for me and February's books were in like a lion and
out like a lamb. Hopefully this literary sunshine continues!
