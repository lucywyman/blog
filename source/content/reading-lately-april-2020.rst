This month sucked. Here's what I read.

`How to Be Fine`_: 5/5
----------------------
*Kristen Meinzer & Jolenta Greenberg*

I've listened to Kristen and Jolenta's podcast *By the Book* for years and was so excited to hear
they had published a book about their experiences. *How to Be Fine* is funny, insightful,
captivating, and uplifting, all in equal measure. The book is brilliantly broken down into 'What to
do', 'What not to do', and 'What more self-help books should advise', with each chapter covering a
'tenet' common to multiple books. Each section includes stories of how Kristen and Jolenta learned
and applied the tenet, detailing their often hilarious and interesting stories. It concludes with a
clear list of takeaways, and how you might apply the tenet to your own life. I loved that this book
was so well organized and full of personality. It's rare to find a book that's both
helpful and fun to read!

`In Five Years`: 4/5
--------------------

*In Five Years* burns slow, then happens all at once. I don't want to spoil it, but it's ultimately
about frienship and the unexpected turns life can take (as you might have gathered from
the blurb!). My main gripe with this book is that the title gives the impression that the main
character's life changes over the course of 5 years, but in reality the book skips 4.5 of those
years (literally there's a page that says "four and a half years later"). I wish it had just been
one year, or that the story had been drawn out over the five years more. With all of that said, I
thought the characters were great - of course I would, I can see parts of myself in both of the
young, ambitious, bright women at the center of the story (that sounds braggy now that I read it
back, and maybe it is). And honestly, for all the flaws of this book, I never knew what was going to
happen next and felt like I had to keep reading. This is a great book if you're looking for
something short and bittersweet.

`The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake`: 3/5
-------------------------------------------
*Aimee Bender*

*The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake* is, in a word, trippy. It's more of a vibe than a novel,
expertly weaving magic into reality that you don't realize it's magical realism until you're
halfway through. I appreciated the familial love that suffused every page, and the way this book
shook me out of my boring old world view. It was a refreshing, if sometimes confusing, change of
pace.

`The Garden of Small Beginnings`: 2/5
-------------------------------------
*Abbi Waxman*

This romance is mostly good for passing the time - there wasn't anything particularly good or bad
about it, it was just...pretty meh.

`Fix Her Up`: 1/5
-----------------

I'm embarrassed to say I finished this book. I needed a romance novel in my life at the time, an
escape from reality - and honestly, if *any* other book had been available at the library I wouldn't
have finished this. "What was so bad about it?", you ask? The heroine in this romance novel is an
*aspiring clown*. Aspiring. Clown. Unless you are also an aspiring clown - or are looking for a good
hearty "What the fuck is this" laugh - I suggest reading anything else.
