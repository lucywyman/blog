Food
~~~~

`A Cozy Kitchen`_
-----------------

Featuring `tasty recipes`_, `a book club`_, and some pretty amazing
`cakes`_, I love Adrianna's artful food photography and decadent
recipes. She's an LA lady with the cutest dang kitchen you've ever
seen, and she puts it to good use!

`Joy the Baker`_
----------------

Joy is my QUEEN! I've never made a recipe of hers that I didn't like,
and her go-with-the-flow, you-only-live-once-so-make-the-best-of-it
way of living is truly inspiring.  She posts `great, easy recipes`_
(and some `baking adventures`_), and includes a weekly post of
articles from around the internet. She's a true joy (ha) to read and
bake with!

`Minimalist Baker`_
-------------------

While I don't necessarily love reading Dana's posts so much, I do love
`her instagram`_ and the incredible arsenal of `recipes`_ she's
amassed on her site. Her food photography is beautiful, and you can
find healthy (for whatever healthy means to you!), tasty, and
satisfying recipes on her blog.

Lifestyle
~~~~~~~~~

`Wit & Delight`_
----------------

I think this is considered a 'design' blog, but honestly most of their
posts are just stories about being a human in the world. I love W+D
for connecting me to other women around the world and understanding
what's on their mind. What's it like to start dating again at 40?
What's it like to have a miscarriage? What *did* happen when you tried
not wearing a bra for 30 days? Understanding others experience through
beautiful story-telling; my kind of blog!

`A Cup of Jo`_
--------------

I'd describe Cup of Jo as 'a little bit of everything'. Her posts are
typically short and casual, almost like checking in with a friend once
every few days, and Joanna has created a wonderful community of
uplifting women. I love that Cup of Jo isn't *trying* to be anything,
or telling you how to live your life. It's just an upbeat check in, a
"y'know what I was thinking about earlier today". I don't know. It's
hard to describe. I highly recommend it!

`Carly the Prepster`_
---------------------

Does anyone else go through weird periods of obsession with a
particular *thing* (song, movie, artist, etc.)? I'm currently crushing
*hard* on Carly. I know it's a phase and that it will pass, but for
now I just love reading her blog and following her on `insta`_ and
`youtube`_. She just seems so kind and upbeat, put-together without
being overly primped, and I love her sense of style. I don't typically
think of myself as a 'preppy' person, and wouldn't spend as much money
as I think she does on my closet, so my obsession seems a little...out
of left field. But for now I'm going with it! (And actually, `this
video`_ inspired me to start trying to blog more!)

`NYT Tip Column`_
-----------------

About once a week the NYT will post a short column with basic tips on
how to do something. This week it was `How to Take a Vow of Silence`_.
It can be anything. How to `climb a coconut tree`_, `write a love letter`_, or `eat spicy foods`_. I love spending a little time
each week pondering following the advice.

`Young House Love`_
-------------------

I mentioned John and Sherry's `podcast`_ in my list of `favorite
podcasts`_ a while back, and while their banter on air cannot be beat
I also enjoy reading their blog! While they are much more handy and
DIY than I ever expect to be, it's very fun to see the projects they
take on. This is the only real 'home design' blog I read, and it's a
good exercise in contemplating the space I'm in. I also love their
upbeat attitudes, and reading about their lovely family.

Money
~~~~~

`Frugalwoods`_
--------------

The Frugalwoods live a life of frugal luxury on a homestead in Vermont, where
Mrs. Frugalwoods write funny and hearty soliloquies on personal finance,
answers reader questions, and describes their lives in rural Vermont. I love
Mrs. Frugalwoods writing style, and her positive attitude towards frugality.
It's hard to put my finger on what in her voice and content resonates so much
with me, but she is hands down one of my favorite writers of any platform. I
highly recommend if you're looking to up your financial game (or like
beautiful pictures of rural New England).

`Mr. Money Mustache`_
---------------------

MMM is THE personal finance blogger, at least in the nerdy circles I run in.
And for good reason: his approach is very similar to the Frugalwoods, which
is living below your means, spending on what matters to you, and growing your
money correctly. MMM is definitely a bit snarkier than the Frugalwoods, but
also has great writing style and aligns very strongly with my personal
values. Preach!

`The Power of Thrift`_
----------------------

Though Anita doesn't always (or even often) blog about finance, I honestly really like reading about her day to day life, her goals, and the books she's reading. More of a lifestyle blog than a financial blog, but very much like catching up with a friend.

Fashion
~~~~~~~

Style Bee
---------

LEE. Like so many, I was enamoured with Caroline Rector of Un-fancy (see
below) for years until she teamed up with Lee of Style Bee. And my life
changed forever. Lee is an ethical fashion blogger, and her style is
*incredible*. If I could style myself half that well...Lee is the best way to
learn about responsible fashion brands, and see them styled + modeled. I love
love love her blog, and can't wait to read more now that she's a full time
blogger!

Un-Fancy
--------

The OG in ethical fashion blogging (at least to me), Caroline has pretty much
stopped blogging at this point. But it's still fun to read through the
archives of her capsule wardrobes, and be inspired by her amazing photography
and closet. An oldie but a goodie.

And that's it! My favorite blogs to read. I hope you found one that you will fall in love with or be inspired by!
