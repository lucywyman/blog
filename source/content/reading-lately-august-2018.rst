It's been a while since I posted what I've been reading lately. We're
still in the dog days of summer, soaking in the sunshine and trying to
ignore the back-to-school ads even though we're not technically on
summer break anymore. My summer has been busy in the best possible
way, and I feel like I've made the most of every moment. There've been
barbecues, berry-picking, hikes, a wedding, movies, ice cream,
farmers markets, and of course so much time with friends and family.
And books! Here's what I've been enjoying lately:

`The Curious Charms of Arthur Pepper`_
--------------------------------------
*Phaedra Patrick*

This was the sweetest book! With great character development and a
charming story, this book surprised me with it's depth of plot and mix
of eccentric and realistic events. It handled real issues of aging,
life after the loss of a loved one, and finding meaning in life, while
also including a scene about a man who only wear electric blue and
owns several tigers. Definitely the feel-good story of the summer!

`When Life Gives You Lululemons`_
---------------------------------
*Lauren Weisberger*

Did you know *The Devil Wears Prada* is a series?? Me neither. This is
the third installment, which I didn't even realize until I looked at
the goodreads page after finishing it. You definitely don't need to
have read the 2nd one to understand this one, and if you like DWP you
will love *When Life Gives You Lululemons*! It's funny, relatable,
heartbreaking, and in the end victorious.

`Save the Date`_
----------------
*Mary Kay Andrews*

A cute enough romance story. I'm honestly not a huge fan of the
love-to-hate trope, but did love that the female lead was a business
owner and in the end grew to like both characters. Not my first
recommendation, but a quick candy read if your romance novel TBR list
has dried up.

`The Handmaid's Tale`_
----------------------
*Margaret Atwood*

I'll be honest: I really didn't like this book. But I still think you
should read it. Since I can't handle watching the show, reading the
book is the next best way to be able to talk to other people about
the story and to understand the nuances of how it's used in everyday
conversation. This book is definitely part of our modern zeitgeist,
and as painful as oflgen's lack of character development and action
is, and as painful as Atwood's over-the-top grandiose writing style
is, there's a lot to unpack and discuss. Get through it, then be like
me and tell everyone all the things you didn't like about it.
