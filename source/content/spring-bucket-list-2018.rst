Spring is nearly here! With warmer, longer days on the horizon I'm
dreaming of all the outdoor, evening-time activities we can start
doing again. And in a new city! I'm moving to Seattle in a week, which
means this Spring will involve a lot of exploring new places, new
experiences, and an opportunity to try new things. In addition to
being in a new place I'll also be living with my partner for the
first time in nearly 2 years, and having weekends back will hopefully
afford me more time to do fun things without having to travel from
city to city or spend the entire weekend with my partner. 

All of this adds up to hearty bucket list for this Spring!

☐  Go to a `book club`_ meeting

☐  Find a volunteering opportunity in Seattle (I'm thinking either the
local library or humane society)

☐  Go to `molten cakes`_ bakery in Capitol Hill

☐  Find a Zumba class to go to regularly

☐  Go to a trivia night at a local bar

☐  Start taking piano lessons

☐  Go to at least 1 concert

☐  Go to a Mariners game

☐  Go to the `tulip festival`_ [and | or] the `apple blossom festival`_

☐  Visit `Kubota Garden`_

Well, certainly seems like I'll be busy in the coming months. While
this list is admittedly a little overwhelming I plan to approach
moving to Seattle like starting college: try a lot of things, meet a
lot of people, and just see what sticks!
