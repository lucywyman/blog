Among the ranks of podcasts NPR creates, one is an aggregated feed of 
technical bits from a variety of news podcasts -- basically a curated, audio
Hacker News.  This past week, everyone has been 
FREAKING OUT about the WFC fight of the century, Apple vs. FBI, in a 
non-stop stream of uninformed (or worse, half-informed) newscasters questioning
whether Apple is doing the right thing by protecting their users privacy*. 
However, in the breaths between FREAKING OUT, there were a few bits on 
self-driving cars, and whether America is ready for them.  The bit focused 
on folks saying they didn't trust self-driving cars

* I'll spare you the drama and to say I side very strongly with Apple, and
  if you don't care to read more about the issue you should as well.  Take 
  it from an engineer.
