This is the third post of my `Thanksgiving Week`_ series. If you
haven't already, I'd recommend reading the `introduction post`_ first!

I know this isn't usually the first (or third) thing folks think of
when considering things they're grateful for, but there are many
aspects of my work that fill me with appreciation and joy. I have the
privilege of doing work that I love, that is challenging, interesting,
and fulfilling, where I get to spend my days learning, creating, and
solving complex problems. What's more I get to do all of this with
people who are smarter and kinder than I am, constantly inspiring me
to grow and be a better human. I work with people I look forward to
seeing, who `respect and care for me`_, who *know* me and who I can be
myself around. I definitely never expected my workplace to be the
first place I went after a national tragedy, and expected even less to
be consoled and comforted by my coworkers. Leaving work that day was
the moment I knew I was in the right place. The cherry on top is that
I work at a company that values my contributions, that makes me feel
welcome, and that works hard to make sure I'm appropriately
compensated for my work.  And my commute is a 30 minute walk! There's
no where else I'd rather spend most of my waking hours, that's for
sure.
