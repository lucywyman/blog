If I Were A Boy

Before attending university I was completely unaware of the diversity problem in
STEM. In high school all of my classes were relatively 50-50 in terms of
gender, including science and math classes, and I had never experienced or
noticed anyone treating me differently than my male peers.  My fist computer
science class at university was ~5% femaleÂ¹, and as I started to consume more tech media (ie. `Hacker News`_)
it became clear the Oregon State was not an exception. 

Even after 3 years of classes like this, I'm really not sure how to feel about
the dearth of diversity in STEM.  But regardless of the emotions I cycle
through or the discussions I have with people, one question that frequently
gets asked is whether people treat me differently because I'm a
woman,or whether
I'm discriminated against. The answer is yes, of course: it's natural that
people treat me differently because I'm a (very feminine) woman, but more than
that I want to address the skeptical tone people take when they ask if I
experience discrimination.  My intention here isn't to shame people for their
skepticism, compare my experiences to those of others, or have this be a "Woe
is me!" post. But I want my peers to be aware that I do experience
discrimination, and have a variety of negative and uncomfortable experiences
that would likely not have happened, or had the same negative meaning, if I
were a boy. 

Etherpad
--------

We use `etherpads`_ to organize events for the `Linux Users Group`_, and 
each new user can identify themselves manually on the etherpad.  However
everyone has access to each name input, so a single user can put whatever
they'd like as each person's name.  Since most new users don't know about 
this feature, or don't care to put their name in, often one person will
put their own name in each name input, so it looks like there are 10 
'Elis' all talking to each other.

So, when planning meetings for LUG this term I took the liberty of doing
this, putting my own name in each of the name inputs.  Later that day 
I reopened the etherpad to find the following text at the bottom  
of the page: "Lucys been a naughty gurl. She gun get fired".  
I'm confident that the note was a very poorly done joke, meant 
to be harmless and completely missing the mark. But it was
humiliating nonetheless.  

The Bus
-------

A male colleague and I were on a bus from Corvallis to Portland, and happened
to be the only people on the bus.  Almost a year earlier we had lightly flirted
in our interactions, but we had never done anything and since that time I had
started seriously (and monogamously) dating my boyfriend. So, the colleague and
I were sitting together, first chatting then watching a movie.  He would
occassionally make uncomfortable comments like "I wouldn't mind seeing you
naked", but I would just ignore them and forge ahead in the conversation,
thinking them relatively harmless. Then when the movie started he picked my
hand up and put it on his upper thigh. Despite being only a 1.5 hour ride, it
felt like the longest of my life. In all fairness I could have dealt with it
much better: I was stunned and had no idea what to do, so ended up using the
computer as an excuse to remove my hand then just tried to keep to myself and
keep distracted for the rest of the ride, never telling him how uncomfortable
that had made me or that it wasn't ok with me.  In retrospect, I should have
said something. Then again, it probably shouldn't have happened in the first
place.


The Maker Fair
--------------

I was manning a Lego Robotics booth at the Corvallis Maker Fair.
I had a little demo set up, and spiel about what my organization did, and 
spent most of the day showing kids how to program the robots and talking 
to very kind parents. As a swarm of kids left the table, one of the event
organizers asked if he could get a short clip of me explaining the demo
and then showing how it worked, and I said sure.  I did the thing, he took
the video, then left with his wife to see other exhibits. A nearby 
man who had seen the exchange came up, and after I started giving my spiel
he stopped me mid sentence and said "You know he just wanted your picture, right?".
Lost for words, I think I just gaped, then turned to someone else and started
helping them with something.  His comment made me so uncomfortable, and 
marred what had been a great morning and memory.

The 21st Birthday
-----------------

By now I had graduated from university, but was visiting Corvallis to see my
boyfriend and celebrate his roommate's 21st birthday.  It was a Friday night,
and as we were touring the bars and restaurants of Corvallis we met a few
people who were friends-of-friends. This resulted in a group of 8-10 people
eating at a pizza joint, only some of whom I knew personally. After long
conversations that I had a hard time contributing to, I found a tiny foothold
for myself: "Oh, yeah, I used to love that mine game...mine stopper?".
"Minesweeper" my friend said. Then, a voice down the table from someone I
didn't know said "No worries, it's got a lot of numbers in it". I hope that he
didn't mean to imply that a game with lots of numbers in it would be hard for
me to remember, enjoy, or be good at. But in the moment it felt like I was
being pushed even further out of a conversation I was already not a part of,
and like that *was* what he was implying.  I left shortly after, holding back
tears, and was told that I should have just said "Fuck you" to the guy and
carried on.  I shouldn't have let it ruin the evening, and should have asserted
that it wasn't an OK thing to say.  But why is that burden on me?  Why didn't
my friends defend me, or even notice that I was visibly upset at the comment?
Why didn't anyone else think it wasn't OK? 

Now that I'm working in the real world, I realize what being treated equally is
like. I love my job, and am a respected colleague at my workplace.  People who
have been in the industry since I was born ask for my opinion, have me review
their work, and I never second guess my standing among them. This makes
discrimination that much clearer to me: each time someone doesn't assume I'm
their equal, it stands out.  It stings. In so many ways, I wish I could go back
to when I didn't notice it. When a comment like that could have been totally
innocuous.  But it's not, anymore.

The Little Things
-----------------

* **09/20/2016**: I walk to work everyday, going down Belmont and
  crossing the Morrison Bridge. I usually leave between 7:30 and 8,
  when it's definitely light outside and there are lots of other
  people walking, biking, and driving the same direction.  I listen to
  a variety of books and podcasts, and am literally wearing
  clothes appropriate for a professional work environment (not that it
  matters, but I just want to set the scene here and provide context).
  About half way through my walk a construction truck was stopped at a
  red light, and as I waited at the same red light one of the men in
  the truck wolf-whistled (loud enough to hear through my headphones),
  then the other yelled "Nice ass, honey!".  I ignored them,
  pretending I hadn't heard, but they're comments got weirdly in my
  head. "Were these jeans not appropriate?  I didn't even put makeup
  on this morning, why are you yelling at me?  Can I melt into the
  ground right now?"  I realized that I was blaming myself for what
  they had said, and wondering what I could do to avoid it in the
  future.  Wear baggier clothes? Maybe I should take the bus?  I
  talked to another female co-worker about it once I got to work, and
  she helped me feel better about it. It wasn't my fault, it didn't
  reflect on me at all, it was just two guys who decided to be
  assholes and make comments about me on my walk into work.
* **09/29/2016**: A female friend and I went to see "The Music of
  David Bowie: The Oregon Symphony" at the Schnitz. It was a
  *wonderful* concert, and as we were walking back to my car, we both
  had our phones out looking up directions to my friend's apartment. A
  man tapped one of us on the shoulder and said "Were you ladies
  filming in there? I'm going to have to confiscate your phones."  We
  both looked at each other terrified.  Were you...? No, neither of us
  had our phones out at all during the concert. We shook our heads
  "No, we didn't do anything", then he laughed and said "I'm just
  kidding, you ladies both look beautiful tonight".  We speed walked
  away, both totally uncomfortable and dreading the long walk to the
  car in the dark. The true skeptic may be thinking "He complimented
  you. Why is this a bad thing?"  Well, 
* **02/24/2017**: In a meeting today the QA team was discussing
  changes to our interview process. At one point a male coworker was
  referring to potential candidates and said "The guy won't get XYZ.
  He might not think to do ABC." and went on to continue referring
  potential candidates as exclusively male for the rest of the
  meeting. It's such a small thing, and I almost brought it up and
  pointed it out, but I know he's not doing it intentionally. But it
  does make clear that we unconsciously think of engineers as being
  male.

Conclusion
----------

My experiences are my own and don't necessarily reflect or represent those 
of all women in STEM fields, but I hope they do humanize the diversity
struggle in those industries and highlight the ways in which sexism is 
still happening.  It's not all bad: I have always received equal pay for 
equal work to my male peers, am respected within the community, and 
have never felt that I was denied an opportunity, promotion, or 
position because I am a woman. At the same time none of the above 
experiences would have happened if I were a boy.

1 This number comes from me very unscientifically counting the number
  of people in class who appeared to be female and asking the professor
  how many students total were in the class.  I understand that appearance
  is not an indicator of gender, and there's possibly errors in 
  mis-identifying individuals, particularly if they're not gender binary.
  I apologize for this, but the point remains the same: the class was 
  *dominated* by male humans
