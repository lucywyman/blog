If I Were A Boy

Before coming to college I was completely unaware of the diversity problem in
STEM.  In high school all of my classes were relatively 50-50 in terms of
gender, including science and math classes, and I had never experienced or
noticed anyone treating me differently than my male peers.  My fist computer
science class came as quite a shock, which had approximately 5% female
attendance*, and as I started to consume more tech media (ie. `Hacker News`_)
it became clear the Oregon State was not an exception. 

Even after 3 years of classes like this, I'm really not sure how to feel about
the dearth of diversity in STEM.  But regardless of the emotions I cycle
through or the discussions I have with people, one question that frequently
gets asked is whether people treat me differently because I'm a woman | whether
I'm discriminated against. The answer is yes, of course: it's natural that
people treat me differently because I'm a (very feminine) woman, but more than
that I want to address the skeptical tone people take when they ask if I
experience discrimination.  My intention here isn't to shame people for their
skepticism, compare my experiences to those of others, or have this be a "Woe
is me!" post. But I want my peers to be aware that I do experience
discrimination, and have a variety of negative and uncomfortable experiences
that would likely not have happened, or had the same negative meaning, if I
were a boy. 

Etherpad
--------

We use `etherpads`_ to organize events for the `Linux Users Group`_, and 
each new user can identify themselves manually on the etherpad.  However
everyone has access to each name input, so a single user can put whatever
they'd like as each person's name.  Since most new users don't know about 
this feature, or don't care to put their name in, often one person will
put their own name in each name input, so it looks like there are 10 
'Elis' all talking to each other.

So, when planning meetings for LUG this term I took the liberty of doing
this, putting my own name in each of the name inputs.  Later that day 
I reopened the etherpad to find the following text at the bottom  
of the page: "Lucys been a naughty gurl. She gun get fired".  
I'm confident that the note was a very poorly done joke, meant 
to be harmless and completely missing the mark. But it was
humiliating nonetheless.  

The Bus
-------

A male colleague and I were on a bus from Corvallis to Portland, and happened
to be the only people on the bus.  Almost a year earlier we had lightly flirted
in our interactions, but we had never done anything and since that time I had
started seriously (and monogamously) dating my boyfriend. So, the colleague and
I were sitting together, first chatting then watching a movie.  He would
occassionally make uncomfortable comments like "I wouldn't mind seeing you
naked", but I would just ignore them and forge ahead in the conversation,
thinking them relatively harmless. Then when the movie started he picked my
hand up and put it on his upper thigh. Despite being only a 1.5 hour ride, it
felt like the longest of my life. In all fairness I could have dealt with it
much better: I was stunned and had no idea what to do, so ended up using the
computer as an excuse to remove my hand then just tried to keep to myself and
keep distracted for the rest of the ride, never telling him how uncomfortable
that had made me or that it wasn't ok with me.  In retrospect, I should have
said something. Then again, it probably shouldn't have happened in the first
place.


The Maker Fair
--------------

Recently I was manning a Lego Robotics booth at the Corvallis Maker Fair.
I had a little demo set up, and spiel about what my organization did, and 
spent most of the day showing kids how to program the robots and talking 
to very kind parents. As a swarm of kids left the table, one of the event
organizers asked if he could get a short clip of me explaining the demo
and then showing how it worked, and I said sure.  I did the thing, he took
the video, then left with his wife to see other exhibits. A nearby 
man who had seen the exchange came up, and after I started giving my spiel
he stopped me midsentence and said "You know he just wanted your picture, right?".
Lost for words, I think I just gaped, then turned to someone else and started
helping them with something.  His comment made me so uncomfortable, and 
marred what had been a great morning and memory.

Conclusion
----------

My experiences are my own and don't necessarily reflect or represent those 
of all women in STEM fields, but I hope they do humanize the diversity
struggle in those industries and highlight the ways in which sexism is 
still happening.  It's not all bad: I have always received equal pay for 
equal work to my male peers, am respected within the community, and 
have never felt that I was denied an opportunity, promotion, or 
position because I am a woman. At the same time none of the above 
experiences would have happened if I were a boy.

If you have an stories of your own that you think belong on this list, 
please email them to me at wyman[dot]lucy[at]gmail[dot]com. You can include
your name if you'd like for me to include it in this post or submit it 
anonymously, and I will add it to this post as soon as possible.  If you
have any other questions or concerns, feels free to email me at that 
address as well. Have a lovely day! 


* This number comes from me very unscientifically counting the number
  of people in class who appeared to be female and asking the professor
  how many students total were in the class.  I understand that appearance
  is not an indicator of gender, and there's possibly errors in 
  mis-identifying individuals, particularly if they're not gender binary.
  I apologize for this, but the point remains the same: the class was 
  *dominated* by male humans
