In honor of International Women's Day, or National Nutrition Month, or 
generally Having a Great Mom, or something, I wanted to give my mom a 
shoutout for teaching me that happy + healthy > skinny.  My mom works *hard* 
for her body, doing an hour-long cardio and strength class (`Jazzercise`_) 
at least 5 days a week.  For more than 30 years. And it shows -- she has 
great blood pressure, a healthy heart rate, and can walk way farther and longer 
than my brother or I (seriously, bring comfortable walking shoes if you 
ever go on vacation with us. Lessons learned the hard way.).  In fact,
a few years ago my mom had her gallbladder removed, came home and 
cooked dinner *that night*. If that's not strong and healthy, call me 
a monkey's uncle.  She also eats what she wants, when she wants, to 
help her body feel good.  From not having a scale in the house, to 
prioritizing intellect and personality over looks, to 
emphasizing exercise and good food, my mom built an ideal body-image
foundation.  This isn't to say I've always had a healthy
relationship with food, but it's been easy to develop one.  I'm 
so grateful to my mom for helping me see that your waistline 
doesn't indicate how healthy you are, that big hispanic booties
are a great ass-et, and that exercising and eating to feel good 
will make me way happeir (and healthier) than dieting ever will.
