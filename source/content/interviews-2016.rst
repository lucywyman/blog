Interviewing is a lot like dating.  You put on your nice clothes. You're 
kind of nervous at first. "Will they like me?", "Am I smiling too much?",
"Was I supposed to tell the story about the frog?", "Oh god, I feel something
between my teeth, oh my god, OH MY GOD, CODE BLUE CODE BLUE FOOD IN TEETH
FOOD IN TEETH WHAT DO WE DO".

Needless to say, it's difficult to stand in judgement of other humans, 
particularly with your career on the line!
So, in an effort to remember and transfer the memories of interviewing, I'm
recording my experiences with a variety of organizations here for posterity
(read: Future Lucy).

**NOTE**: I won't be discussing
any details of questions asked during the interviews, and 
will omit the names of anyone who interviewed me.

The Process
-----------

So, as I recently learned, the interview process for 
most tech organizations has three parts. 

0. The application. This is like the profile part of 
   online dating. You submit your resume, the shiniest
   version of yourself in the form of paper, but you lie about 
   knowing Rust instead of liking beer.

1. The HR person. This is usually a 10-15 minute call
   with a really nice person
   where they ask things like "What are you interested in?",
   "When do you graduate?", "Are you willing to relocate?", etc.
   They're just trying to ascertain if you're a good fit for the 
   position you're interviewing for. This is the initial chat
   of online dating, but less awkward.

2. The technical interview.  This is 1 or 2 phone calls
   with an engineer where they ask you to solve a problem or 
   two in a shared document. The problems are almost always 
   related to algorithms, data structures, or networking.
   Seriously, know your networks man.  This is the first/second 
   date stage of the interview, where you try to decide if
   this is even someone you want to get involved with and if 
   there's any possibility for romance.

3. The on site. If your technical interviews go well and 
   you seem like a good fit, you'll have an on site interview.
   This is like 1-2 years of dating in 5 hours.  This is where the company 
   flies you down to their
   location and interviews you for 5-6 hours in 45-60 minute 
   chunks, usually with 1-2 engineers per interview.  Yes, they
   are exhausting, no matter how many times people ask if you
   need water or coffee. It also gives you an appreciation for 
   how arduous transporting humans from point A to point B is.
   This is their (and your) last chance to see if you're ready 
   to commit.  

After the onsite, you're just waiting to hear back. Usually it takes between
a week and a month, but if you haven't heard anything in 1.5 to 2 weeks it's 
appropriate to contact the recruiter you've been talking to and ask when 
you should expect to know.  

The Companies
-------------

Apple
~~~~~

I interviewed with Apple on a Monday in early January.  You know 
those industrial parks you go to when your Comcast shit isn't working, 
where they have miles of rectangular concrete buildings where souls go to die?
That's what Apple HQ looks like.  I know, I know, they're building a new
campus that's going to be the bestest tech campus in The World and Mars, but
for now it's pretty subpar.  There's nothing to see or do in Cupertino, so 
when I got there an hour early I ended up just going to Safeway and getting 
mouth wash.  After checking in and hanging out for a while, the marathon began.

I ended up having 6 45-minute interviews with a lunch break after Round 2. 
Each interview was with two engineers from the team I was applying to be on, 
and overall I thought I showed as well as I could have.  There were some 
engineers I instantly clicked with and really liked, and others that were
much less inviting, but on the whole it was as pleasant as 7 hours of 
interviewing can be.  More often than not the interviewing wrapped up
early, and in asking their engineers about how they liked Apple it 
was clear that every engineer there drank the Apple kool-aid. Maybe this 
seems obvious since they work there, but interviewing at Apple made me 
realize how important Open Source Software is to me.  I thought it was 
something I could take or leave, but sentences like "I enjoy the big 
reveals, a lot of times I have no idea what the final product will
look like as we're working on it" or "I can't talk to my neighbor
about what I'm doing" gave me literal chills.  It's definitely for 
some people, just not me. There were also startingly few women at
Apple, particularly in engineering roles, which was another big red
flag for me.  This isn't to say Apple's a bad place or company, just
that it wasn't the right fit for me.

Google
~~~~~~

Google (Mountianview) had a *beautiful* campus. I got there ~2 hours early, and spent the whole
time exploring sites like the Android Garden, little google shops, and generally
wandering around. It's like it's own small, clean city with beautiful landscapes,
an amphitheater, movies, shops, and so on.

Once I was in the right place, the interviewing
began right away.  As I said, I won't discuss the details of questions asked, but 
the google interview questions were very fun to consider, reason about, and optimize.
I found myself thinking about the questions over the next few days and trying to 
improve my answers, and at the end of the day found that I was energized rather than
exhausted by the problems put before me.  You can find some `retired google interview
questions`_ online, but I will say that in my experience they're unlike questions 
asked by any other company.  Use for fun or brain work, not general interview practice.
The engineers were all very nice and interesting, and it was clear that each was 
passionate about technology and working at Google (of course).  Though this was 
exciting as a soon-to-be graduate, it also hinted at how each persons *life* 
was Google, and seemed that culturally it would be very hard to have kids or 
real hobbies outside of work.  I know this is something they are working on, and 
can't confirm that this is culturally true, it was just the vibe I got during 
my very short time there.

This onsite consisted of 4 hour-long interviews with a lunch break, each 
interview being one-on-one, which I found much more manageable than two-on-one.
The interviews were very directed and structured, which I really liked, and left
plenty of time for me to ask questions of my interviewers.  It's also worth
mentioning that my interviewers were diverse in terms of race, gender, and age,
which was refreshing. Once I had finished, I was on my way!  Google has a very 
nifty interview process, whereby a committee reviews your interview
based on notes the interviewers take in order to minimize any biases the 
interviewers may have. The committee then determines whether to hire you or 
not, *then* once you're hired they place you in a department or project you're
interested in. So you don't interview for a particular position, and you're 
not competing with other brains for the same job: it's just a matter of 
whether you're up to snuff. 

Overall I had a really good time interviewing for Google, and despite
not getting the job consider it a great experience. 

Linux Foundation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I didn't get as far into the LF interview process, but want to write
about it because their code challenge *consumed* my life for a solid 
week. This is mostly my own fault: the challenge was to create a 
site using Drupal, which I have ample experience doing, and so 
as a challenge I chose to use Drupal 8 instead of 7.  Never. Again.
Drupal 8 has some great and cool features, namely better templating.
But it's not well documented, not widely used, and is *way* 
different from Drupal 7. I was in way over my head, and honestly 
spent probably close to 50 hours on a project that was supposed 
to take 8.  I'm sure some LF folks will read this and chuckle, 
but it was an emotional technical journey that I'm glad I took. 
As arduous as it was, it feels strangely pleasurable to get sucked
into a project like that, and I learned a whole lot about Drupal.
This doesn't really reflect LF at all, but I guess can be 
taken as a lesson regarding how great interviews can be regardless 
of whether you get the job?  Or something.  I just thought you
all should know.

Puppet
~~~~~~

I won't go on about how much I enjoyed 
interviewing at Puppet. I interned there the previous summer, so 
much of that enjoyment was in seeing old friends and getting 
lots of hugs. I also know that raving about stuff sounds 
cheesy and fake like squeezy cheese, and this blog post is 
not about squeezy cheese. Barf. 

Puppet's interview was 6 45-minute interviews, each with 2
engineers from the team I would be working on, and including 
a one-on-one lunch.  The interviews were pretty standard stuff
(tell us about yourself, answer technical questions, etc.), but
in interviewing my interviewers it was clear that Puppet 
prioritized *having a life* outside of work. Most people had
kids, and everyone had a variety of hobbies as well, from 
motorcycling to painting to construction and so on.  I know 
work-life balance isn't a key word for everyone, but 
for me personally it was a huge relief to know that I wouldn't be
expected to work 60-80 hours/week and could pursue other 
interests after hours.  Puppet 100%
won on diversity as well, with a wide variety of races, ages, 
and gender non-binary interviewers.  All in all, it was 
a really fun day, and cemented for me that Puppet was 
the right place for me. 

I'll emphasize again that I'm very biased, particularly since
I accepted the job at Puppet and had worked there previously.

Conclusion
----------

I started looking for a job in mid-November and accepted the 
position at Puppet mid-March. Finding a job is *hard*, even
as a fully-qualified, young, white woman with years of 
previous work experience.  Not only is it hard to get an offer,
but it's hard to research companies you're interested in, optimize
your resume, apply, hope, schedule calls, take time between 
classes talking to recruiters and engineers for hourse, fly or drive
offsite for a full day of interviews, hear "We're sorry but..." over
and over and over. I have to admit that I was expecting the 
interview process to take time, but underestimated how much energy
and emotion and effort it would take.  I've learned a lot about
the job market, about what I value and need in a career, and 
about where I stand in comparison with my peers. But I'm 
also thrilled with where I landed, and could not be 
more excited to start working at Puppet this summer. I 
wish anyone reading this before job searching good luck, 
and hope that your experiences are enlightening if not 
fruitful.  

As always, remember: 

* If you don't get a position, it's not *your* fault. 
  I interview candidates for the `OSU Open Source Lab`_
  and most of the time a candidate is well-suited to the 
  position, but there's just someone else we think would be 
  a little bit better.  It's not personal, it's not mean, 
  it's not that you're not good enough. It's not *you*.
* Think about your values, and whether a company aligns with
  them. It's so tempting to just go for prestige: Google, Apple,
  Intel, etc. But if you're not crazy about how that company 
  operates, or what it makes, you don't want to spend years
  working there.  Do your research, and *know what you want*.
* Companies want the same thing you do: for this to be a good 
  fit! If they don't think it is, then maybe they're right: 
  maybe it's not the right place for you.  Find a company
  that's stoked to bring you on board!
