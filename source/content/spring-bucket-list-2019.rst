Once again springtime finds me relocating to a new city, only this
time it's also an old city. This bucket list is more of a 'things to
do before we leave Seattle' list, but lucky for us Seattle has many
wonderful offerings in the spring! A small part of me is going to miss
the Emerald city, but I'm overwhelmingly excited to be moving back to
where my family and friends and coworkers and beloved `Los Gorditos`_
are. Until then, we'll be making the most of our last spring in SEA!

* Go to the `tulip festival`_ [and | or] the `apple blossom festival`_
* Visit Bainbridge Island
* Visit the `Living Computer Museum`_
* Go to a garage sale
* See the Seattle Japanese Garden
* Cook a meal entirely from Farmer's Market finds
* Move to Portland!!!

Keeping it short and sweet this season - we've got a busy few months
ahead of us, and I don't want to get overwhelmed. Just whelmed.
Whelmed is good.
