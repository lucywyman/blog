Summer is here! Summer is here! I know this summer's bucket list
features a few repeats from `last year's`_, but after a busy `spring`_
I'm ready for some lazy days. Summer is my season! I love being
outside all day, soaking in the sun, eating fresh produce, and
enjoying the long nights. Everything looks brighter, like life
was in black and white for the last few months and now we're in Oz.
I'm so excited for my first summer in Seattle, and can't wait to see
what adventures await us in the coming months! Ok, enough sun-crazed
excitement for now, let's peek at what we'll be up to this year:

.. _last year's: http://blog.lucywyman.me/summer-bucket-list-2017.html
.. _spring: http://blog.lucywyman.me/spring-bucket-list-2018.html

☑  Go on a 5 mile hike

☑  Go berry picking

☑  Ride the Seattle Ferris Wheel (We didn't technically do this
because we got there and realized it was $14 per person to ride, which
we just couldn't stomach. But I'm giving us credit for going out
there).

☑  Make s'mores

☑  Host a barbecue

☑  Go to Shakespeare in the park OR a movie in the park

☑  Go to a trivia night at a local bar

☑  Bake *something* (hopefully `this strawberry tart`_) (ended up
being this `banana bread`_)

So many food related things! Hopefully berry-picking and
strawberry-tart-making can happen back-to-back ;)
