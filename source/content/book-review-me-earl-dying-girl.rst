`Me and Earl and the Dying Girl`_ takes the typical cancer story and 
turns it on it's head.  This was another book I started with no expectations,
though unlike `Brooklyn`_ I was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't inspiring or
great or anything, nor does it claim to be. It's a very real portrait of 
high school, and of someone you know of (but don't really *know*) dying.
As with any media set in high school your mileage may vary -- no one
has the same experience, and there were definitely a lot of inconsistencies
with my experience of high school. But no matter what your experience was,
it takes you back to the time before adulthood, and the first time you 
experienced that confusion and sadness of loss. The main character, Greg, 
is a self-depricating, uninspired human in the thick of the teenage years. 
He's incredibly well-written, and allows you to forget that he's totally 
fiction. It was a great break from
a few more heady books I'm in the middle of, and is a great weekend read
if you're looking for something more seroius than a romance novel but less 
serious than LOTR.
