The guiltiest of pleasures! I *love* `Fixer Upper`_ for all the
reasons you might expect. It's funny, cute, inspiring, and simple.
There's no conflict, or bad guys, or explosions, or skin-tight suits.
Just a Texan couple, making houses beautiful. `The Magnolia Story`_
details the life of Chip and Joanna before the show; how they met, how
they came to flip houses, and how they got to be on TV. Their story is
sweet and heartfelt, and it's clear that they had to *work* to get to
where they are. The book was a sweet treat, a sunny and happy break from the rainy
Portland winter and January melancholy that I really needed. If you
love the show like I do, you'll definitely love the book! Plain and
simple.
