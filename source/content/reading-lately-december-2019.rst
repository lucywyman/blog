December was a crazy, busy, social month for us. Between our respective office
Christmas parties, drinks with friends who were in town, family gatherings, and
one Harry Potter themed dinner, we ate enough free cookies to last us all year.
It was wonderful to see everyone, catch up with old friends and make new ones,
and it's so nice to remember what we value most: the people in our lives. We
both tend towards working too much, and even on break I can feel myself itching
to be productive. This season is always a reminder that our value isn't in our
work or productivity, it's in our relationships with family and friends.

Despite the busyness I read *a lot* this month, mostly in an effort to reach my
100 book goal by the end of the year (which I did!). Some are shorter books,
but what helped me read so much was that so many of them were fantastic,
mind-blowing, life-changing reads (plus a lot of re-reads). Mostly I think I
got lucky that several holds I'd had for months came in at the library at the
same time. It made December reading a delightful escape, and ended the year
with a literary bang.

`Burnout`_: 5/5
---------------
*Emily Nagoski and Amelia Nagoski*

In 2 words, Burnout is about women and stress. It starts out by explaining
what, physiologically, stress is, and why we evolved to be stressed. As we were
evolving we would be stressed for short periods of time, then *complete the
stress cycle* by coming down from stress and recovering from it in a variety of
ways. We weren't meant to be stressed for long periods of time, and a big
problem with modern stress is that we don't complete the cycle and de-stress.
The book then talks about a variety of common stressors and how to manage them,
from small things (drink more water) to bigger life changes (move so your
commute is shorter). The whole book is crowded with research and study
citations, many of them by the author Emily Nagoski herself.

What I loved about this book is how compassionate the authors are. They wrote
the book after each experiencing extreme stress in different ways (Amelia was
hospitalized), and they wanted to help other women manage their own stress
based on what they've learned about it. The tone of the book was warm, and of
course the data and science was thorough without being dry. After reading this
I've started to make sure I see friends more often and talk about what on my
mind, and am starting to identify when I'm stressed and take notes. In the era
of commercialized self-care this may seem like just another product tryin to
get a piece of the pie, but it's genuine and actionable. I've already got it on
hold to reread it.

Side note: The audiobook was narrated by the authors, who are twins! They
alternate chapters, and hearing it in their voice made the book hit home that
much more.

`The Witches Are Coming`_: 5/5
------------------------------
*Lindy West*

I could listen to Lindy West read a phonebook, and I'm sure she'd make it equal
parts funny, insightful, and inspiring. West's debut book `Shrill`_ introduced
me to fatphobia, and the idea that our concept of beauty is enitrely learned
and contrived by companies. I can't say I overcame or even confronted my own
relationship with my body and food, and my anxieties around being fat.  But I
did start to think that the pressure to be thin was manufactured, and realize
my worth wasn't tied to my weight. 'The Witches Are Coming' has the same smart,
witty tone that 'Shrill' did, with a slight pivot in topic to feminism in
modern culture. West covers #MeToo, Trump, abortions, misogyny, racism, and
more with humor and intellect, and her writing is riveting and inspiring as
always. This book felt like it was written *for me*, in it's references, and
subjects, and points of view. I found myself chorusing 'Amen' after every
single chapter - whether you already agree with her and want a rallying cry, or
don't agree with her and are wrong, you should read this.

`Holidays on Ice`_: 5/5
-----------------------
*David Sedaris*

I read 'The Santaland Diaries' every year around the holidays, an irreverent
tradition, and it never fails to make me laugh and get me in the holiday
spirit. My favorite part is the elf-training David suffers, followed closely by
Snowball the flirty elf. If you haven't had the pleasure I highly recommend the
seasonal treat, particularly the audiobook which is narrated by Sedaris
himself.

Harry Potter books 2, 3, and 4: 5/5
-----------------------------------
*J. K. Rowling*

I've `waxed poetic`_ about HP enough on this blog. Needless to say rereading
the series has been a wonderful mood boost during a stressful season.

`The Idea of You`_: 4.5/5
-------------------------
*Robinne Lee*

Wowza this book was ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥. A thinly veiled Harry Styles fan-fic, 'The Idea of
You' follows SolÃ¨ne as she meets and romances Hayes Campbell, an ultra-famous
boy band member. Every scene is laced with sexual tension, and about 40% of the
book is fantasy-inducing sex scenes. I only read about 2/3 of the book, until
I could tell conflict was brewing, then stopped. But those first 2/3s were
*fun*.

`Veronica Mars: The Thousand-Dollar Tan Line`_ & `Veronica Mars: Mr. Kiss and Tell`_: 4/5
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Rob Thomas, Jennifer Graham*

I've never the Veronica Mars TV show or movies, but knew the premise and that
I'd be apt like it. Since so much of what shines in Veronica Mars is the
dialogue, the books are (I'm guessing) a bit toned down from the wit and
snappiness of the show. But I can definitely see why it's done so well -
Veronica is witty but flawed, and the mysteries are interesting without feeling
contrived. It was easy to listen to both these books over 3 days, and I hope
they come out with more!

`The Unhoneymooners`_: 3/5
--------------------------
*Christina Lauren*

Pretty classic modern romance novel. Assumptions are made, lack of
communication causes conflict, hate-to-love. It was wonderful to escape dreary
December and read about Hawaii for a few days though, and I did like and root
for both the hero and heroine. Enjoyable but unremarkable.

`Landline`_: 3/5
------------------
*Rainbow Rowell*

This reminded me so much of `George and Lizzie`_ in that it was about a
middle-aged couple who's relationship had hit the rocks and forced them to
reflect on how they met in the first place. The main characters were also
mostly similar in the demeanor (though with meaningful differences - I'm not
accusing of plagiarism!), and the story followed a similar format of flashing
back. This book was sweet if not great, and while I wish that the heroine had
gotten together with her best friend instead of her husband I suppose that's
just how some books go.

`The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy`_: 3/5
--------------------------------------------
*Douglas Adams*

I honestly appreciate that this book is funny, and get why it's part of the
zeitgeist. I think I was just too stressed to enjoy the silly humor, and even
then that it just wasn't quite for me. I'll still quote it just as much as
before though.

`The Deal of a Lifetime`_: 2/5
------------------------------
*Frederik Backman*

I don't think I got this book...it was supposedly a heart-warming Christmas
novella, reminiscent of 'A Christmas Story'. A wealthy man who has dedicated
his life to making money is confronted by death, and rethinks his priorities.
It was a little too poetic for me though, and the story between the lines got
fuzzy for me. Ultimately it was forgettable and just kind of weird.
