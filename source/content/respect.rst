**DISCLAIMER**: My experiences are entirely my own and don't
necessarily reflect the experiences of others, including other women
at my company. 

It's no secret that there's an `incredible shortage`_ of women in the
tech industry, and even less of a secret that `women are treated
differently than men`_, particularly in tech. This discrimination manifests itself in a lot of
ways, but for the most part it comes down to a single fact: **we think
it's ok to disrespect women**.  Often times this is completely
subconscious, which doesn't absolve us of responsibility but does
point out how deeply ingrained in us sexism is. I, too, am guilty of
assuming my friend's pronoun-less colleague is a "he", and assuming
Bob knows what he's talking about but Alice doesn'tÂ¹.  So when I
recently took a job at my company, I unconsciously expected some of
this bias to color my daily interactions. I didn't even think about
it; of course it was something I would have to deal with. I was a lady
programmer at the bottom of the corporate totem pole. Why should men
with 20+ years of experience in the field listen to me?

Against all of my unconscious and grim expectations my co-workers at
my company treat me as a qualified peer.  They ask for my input and
thoughts on important decisions. They pause and *listen* when I speak,
considering what I say with as much weight as they would anyone else
on the team. They don't laugh when I ask a question or shame me for
not knowing a fact, instead pointing out that it's *great* that I'm
asking questions and should continue to do so if I don't know
something.  They explain things with patience and clarity and not an
ounce of condescension, and have taken entire man-days to help get me
up to speed on specific projects and technologies.  Working for
my company, and specifically with this team, has given me a greater
understanding of how to be respectful as well as be respected.  I
realized all of the little things that my peers at university said and
did -- that *I also* said and did -- that indicated a lack of respect
and awareness, and am slowly learning to not do those things. It's
entirely a work in progress, and I still say or do things that I'm not
proud of.  But I'm much more aware of when I slip up, why, and am able
to apologize and move on more quickly.

What's most amazing is that all of this is done without any fanfare.
It was taken for granted that I was an intelligent, worthy team member
who has as much to contribute as anyone else on the team. My ideas
were always measured equally, and without the obvious effort or
uneasiness of those learning to respect women. My company has created a
place where I feel welcome, comfortable, and safe. 

So why am I telling you this?  Because 6 months ago I thought I would
always have to live with an undercurrent of misogyny.  I thought I
would always be shamed for not knowing some fact, or not getting the
video game reference. And I want you to know that *you can expect
more*. I read so many heartbreaking articles and stories about what
women go through at work, and know first hand how *hard* it is to be a
minority in the tech industry. And I want to emphasize that my
experience does **not** diminish or invalidate the experiences of
others. The way women are treated in my industry is not OK. But I want
you to know that *it isn't always like that*, that it *doesn't have to
be that way*. My company isn't perfect.  Heck, of our 130 engineers
only ~10% identify as female.  **10%**.  They just increased maternity
leave from **two weeks** to six weeks.  But I am valued and
appreciated, implicitly and explicitly. And for that, I am incredibly
privileged and thankful.

*Thank you for reading!  If you are interested in learning more about
being an ally to minorities, I highly recommend the article* `Being an
Effective Ally`_.  *It has been a guiding light to me*

[1] Being aware of that bias has helped me stop doing those things,
but it takes time and concious effort to do so.
