What a sweet book. This book is a glass of warm milk before bed.  It's
the one fuzzy blanket you have that is so soft and fits perfectly
around you. It's comforting, and homey -- the perfect antidote for
this indefinite winter.

`Kitchens of the Great Midwest`_ follows the astonishing life of Eva
Thorvald through the lens' of those around her, and their own personal
failures and triumphs. This is honestly one book where I don't want to give too much
away, and may have even already over-hyped the book and ruined your
opinion of it forever (in which case, I am so, so sorry). But what I
can say is that you will definitely want to get your hands on this
book and then wait until your shoes are soggy and your heart is
aching. Then it will be your perfect bowl of chicken soup.
