While I haven't seen *every* movie nominated for an Oscar this year, 2017 was a
*great* year for movies and I'm particularly excited about the famous
(infamous?) awards show this year. I'm disappointed that movies like `Dunkirk`_
and `The Darkest Hour`_ are still getting attention, particularly compared to
movies like `I, Tonya`_ and `The Florida Project`_ which are frankly not
getting the recognition they deserve. But whatever, white men clearly still run
the world and have a hard-on for watching other powerful men kill each other.
It's fine, everything is fine. 

With that, I plan to have a few sections to this piece:

* Nominees you should see
* Movies not nominated, but worth watching
* Nominees worth skipping
* Award predictions

I wanted to include a "What I Hope Wins" section, but honestly the movies I
love are not actually the highest quality movies. It's a hard distinction to
draw, but while I want 'Call Me By Your Name' to win everything and to have
Timothée Chalamet give his acceptance speech in French, it definitely wasn't
the best picture released last year. 

So, without further ado, here's my movie advice for this weekend:

.. _The Florida Project: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5649144/

What You Should See:
--------------------

* `Call Me By Your Name`_: Summer romance in Northern Italy, with Armie Hammer? Sign me up.
* `Get Out`_: The funny horror movie about race in America, this movie squarely hits the mark. Very well written + acted.
* `Lady Bird`_: While I don't fully appreciate why this movie is so critically acclaimed, it was a very enjoyable coming-of-age movie.
* `The Shape of Water`_: *Incredible* acting, and way less weird than I expected.
* `3 Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri`_: Timely, touching, dramatic, memorable. This was, in every sense of the word, a great movie.
* `I, Tonya`_: Not only does it tell a well-remembered American story, but
  *way* this movie tells the story is sublime. The interviews, the
  cinematography, the absurd characters. And that scene where Margot Robbie
  cries in the mirror? Amazing.

.. _Call Me By Your Name: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5726616/
.. _Get Out: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5052448/
.. _Lady Bird: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4925292/
.. _The Shape of Water: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5580390/
.. _3 Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5027774/
.. _I, Tonya: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5580036/

Not nominated, but still great:
-------------------------------

* `Baby Driver`_: While I wouldn't consider this a "great" movie, it was so entertaining! I wish it had been nominated for more awards.
* `Logan Lucky`_: Same as above: this movie isn't the masterpiece that some of the movies above are, but was still very well done.
* `Wonder Woman`_: Hopefully everyone has already seen this, but if not *what are you doing I'm worried about you*.

.. _Baby Driver: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3890160/
.. _Logan Lucky: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5439796/
.. _Wonder Woman: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0451279/

Don't Bother Seeing:
--------------------

* `All the Money in the World`_: I appreciate Michelle Williams off-screen, but literally the chair I sat in was a better actress than she was in this film.
* `The Darkest Hour`_: Do yourself a favor and don't pay $10 to take a nap, and watch *yet another* WWII movie. 
* `Dunkirk`_: Literally could be the same movie as The Darkest Hour. 
* `Molly's Game`_: While this wasn't a bad movie, I didn't love it and wouldn't recommend it. It was just kind of boring.

.. _All the Money in the World: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5294550/
.. _The Darkest Hour: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4555426/
.. _Dunkirk: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5013056/
.. _Molly's Game: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4209788/

I Haven't Seen

* `Phantom Thread`_: Because I heard it was super boring
* `The Post`_: Because I heard it was super boring

.. _Phantom Thread: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5776858/
.. _The Post: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6294822/
