This is a total candy read for me.  The book follows a middle class woman,
Evelyn, trying to break into the hyper-rich socialite society she grew up on
the fringes of.  Her life spirals completely out of control, and it's all about
how she deals with it. This book was totally about expectations, and it 100%
met my expectations of a fun summer read.  It was definitely entertaining, 
interesting characters, and a very satisfying ending. If you like girly
fun reads like me, this is definitely worth putting on your summer list!
