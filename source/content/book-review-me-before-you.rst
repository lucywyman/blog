Holy. Cannoli. I was very skeptical of `this book`_ when I picked it up. I 
originally saw it at Powell's and put it on my to-read list, but then those
*sappy* ads began running a few weeks later and I got worried.  Don't let the
ads fool you though: this was a *great* novel. I laughed. I cried. I finished
it in two days.  The book follows Louisa Clark, a recently unemployed barista
who needs a job to help her family make ends meet. She takes a job as a 
sort of low-level care-giver for a quadriplegic man named Will Traynor, and 
soon finds out that he plans to carry out assisted suicide in a few months. 
She takes that time to try to convince him that life, even in a wheelchair
with limited mobility, is worth living, a task which ends up taking the 
couple on some (mis)adventures.  It's...kind of a love story?  There's 
definitely romance. But also *so much more*.  As an able-bodied person, we 
so rarely think about accessibility, and increasing the comfort and quality of
life for those with disabilities.  I had never thought about how hard navigating
the mall would be in a wheel chair, how it would feel to not be able to exercise,
and how out of control every aspect of life would be. This read definitely changed
my view of disability, and gave me a lot of appreciation and gratitude for my
body.  It sounds heavy now, but this book is *juicy* as well. 100% page turner.
Definitely worth putting on your summer list!
