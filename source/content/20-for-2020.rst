I started this post `last year`_ with "I usually hate New Years, but...". This
year I'm going to come right out and say it: I hate New Years. All of January,
really. It's cold, wet, and dark, without the joy and lights of Christmas. Bah, humbug.

Luckily I've given myself a lot to look forward to this winter. We're visiting
my uncle and cousins in Napa at the end of January then jetting off to Cancun
for my birthday, both of which I'm so excited for. Wedding planning has also
given me a lot to do and look forward to, which takes my mind off of winter.
I'm lucky that our families don't have a lot of expectations or requests, so
our wedding is basically a big party I get to throw for all our friends and
family with a huge budget. I get to make it exactly what I want, which makes
planning...honestly a joy. It's also been great to plan with my mom - she's
really hyped about the wedding, and it's been so fun to spend more time with
her trying on dresses, tasting cakes, and picking out earrings. I think having
a project we both work on is great, and I mostly wish I could have another
wedding after this one!

Speaking of post-wedding life, one thing on my mind for 2020 is how there are
a finite number of these big 'life changes' you can have: graduate from high
school, graduate from university, move, travel, get married, get a dog, have
babies, start a new job. We're starting to run low on exciting life changes,
particularly given we don't want to have kids for at least a few more years,
and I worry that our life will settle into a rut in the meantime.  While 2020
will be 'The Year of the Wedding' (and hopefully 'The Year Elizabeth Warren
Becomes President'), it'll also be the start of our lives post-wedding. I don't
have a resolution for this, but I hope I can find things to be meaningful and
memorable after the wedding. I want to have a life in between getting married
and having kids, and there isn't really an example I've seen of what that might
look like. Just working and occasionally travelling? If that's what I want to
do, great! I only want to avoid putting my life in cruise-control, and live out
these last kid-less years as much as I can.

On that note....the things I want to do in 2020:

1. Get married!
2. Train myself to sleep on my back. I'm currently a side-sleeper, and I can
   feel how it's starting to affect my posture and shoulders.
3. Submit a crossword to the NYT
4. Go to at least 5 spanish meetups
5. Run a sub-7 minute mile
6. :strike:`Sign up for my own health insurance`
7. Get a new bike
8. Host board games with friends at least 3 times
9. Take 2 hikes in Portland that I've never done
10. Fill up a notebook with notes from work
11. Figure out what to do after the wedding
12. Volunteer at least 3 times
13. Meditate before bed 5 days per week
14. Go camping for the first time
15. Start composting
16. Zero plastic to-go utensils or containers
17. Read a science fiction book
18. Send a letter in the mail
19. Buy an ornament on our international trips
20. Go to a concert
