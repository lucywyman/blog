`When Breath Becomes Air`_ is the memoir of Paul Kalanithi,
who at 36, on the verge of completing his residency to become
a neurosurgeon, is diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. Written
in his last year of life, the book is about coming to terms with
death and living a meaningful life, through the eyes of both a
doctor and a patient. It's an incredibly emotional read, and 
Paul's voice and writing are absolutely stunning. The content
as well as delivery are beautiful, and I found myself crying 
on the way to class listening to the very end. A short and
worthwhile read for any audience.
