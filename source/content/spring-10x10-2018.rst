For the first time ever, I'm participating in the `10 x 10`_
challenge, hosted by `Lee of Style Bee`_ and `Caroline of Unfancy`_.
For those who don't know, Lee and Caroline are bloggers in the
responsible + ethical fashion space who have been a huge influence on
my closet and shopping tendencies. They focus on slow, mindful
fashion, on investing in quality pieces, and most importantly on not
buying clothes just for the sake of buying them! Each season they host
a `10 x 10`_ challenge where you choose 10 items of clothing and
create 10 outfits over the course of 10 days. I've always watched from
afar, too chicken to post to my personal instagram or commit to
limiting my closet. But this is the season! We're trying new things,
and not being scared.

I'll be posting my items and outfits to `@lucygetsdressed`_ on insta
if you want to follow along, but for now here are the items I'll be
wearing over the next 10 days:
