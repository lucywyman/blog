While November was a wonderful month for me personally, it wasn't
great in terms of literature. I had a lot of of stops-and-starts this
month, with books I'd put on hold with every intention to read and
then found I didn't want to pick up or finish. `Florida`_ by Lauren
Groff, an author I *know* I don't enjoy yet insist on giving a new
chance every few months. `All We Ever Wanted`_ by Emily Giffin, which
sounded interesting but just felt like too much after hearing so much
about the election. `The Travelling Cat Chronicles`_ by Hiro Arikawa,
which just wasn't my cup of tea. A lot of half-read and unopened
novels on the shelf this month.

But! It was a fantastic month besides. I helped run a tech conference
early in the month, and got to spend time with wonderful people whom I
don't see enough of. Thanksgiving was perfect; my parents joined Eli's
family for the big meal, and it was the best weekend of relaxation,
food, good company, laughter, and joy that I can remember having in a
while. And through it all, here's what I was reading:

`You, Me, Everything`_

I feel like I should have liked this book more than I did. There's
nothing about it I *didn't* like - I enjoyed the main characters, felt
like they developed and changed in interesting ways, and the
information reveals throughout kept me reading. It just fell a little
flat, for whatever reason, and was more sad than I was anticipating
(in a good way!). *Shrug*. I hope they make it into a movie, because
it's set in the South of France and I think would be visually
*stunning* and emotional in real life rather than a novel.

`Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows`_
------------------------------------
*Balli Kaur Jaswal*

I loved this book! I found each character's story so compelling, of
course loved the strong cultural and feminist tones, and thought the
mystery kept things interesting and timely. This was very nearly a
perfect Lucy book.

`The Pun Also Rises`_
---------------------

This one might not be for everyone, but I've recently taken an
interest in wordplay and enjoyed the wit and humor in this book. It
is, of course, full of puns and approaches the subject of wordplay and
language development with curiosity and whimsy. But it also details a
(euro-centric) history of how wordplay was culturally perceived, and
important moments and characters in the development of the pun. A
great gift for the english major in your life.

`To Love Jason Thorn`_
----------------------

Besides 'little one' being THE WORST pet name in the history of
romance novels, this is a pretty good romantic read. It's not a
hate-to-love trope, which already puts it in like the top 10% of
romance novels. And on top of that there are interesting and very
realistic conflicts around relationships amid fame, and romance with your
brothers friend. This was a layered read that was really more a great
rom-com with steamy sex scenes. As long as you can get past 'little
one', which I would understand if you couldn't.

`The Proposal`_
---------------

Another book I thought I would like more than I did. Diverse
characters, a strong, sassy, independent female lead with an equally
strong-willed and compassionate male lead. The conflicts were totally
believable, the story was cute and compelling. All the elements are
there! I'm not sure why I wasn't head-over-heels for this modern
romance, but for whatever reason it was just ok for me.
