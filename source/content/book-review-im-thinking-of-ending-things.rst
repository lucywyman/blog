`I'm Thinking of Ending Things`_ is a debut novel by Iain Reid, and
was a surprising delight to read. Like most books I checked it out
only knowing that Powell's had it on their 'New + Recommended' list,
and was pleased when I found myself in the middle of a psychological
thriller, begging the protagonist not to go into the basement. The
novel starts out innocuously, and it wasn't until maybe 2/3 of the way
through that I realized it wasn't going the direction I expected *at
all*.  I don't want to give too much away, but this a quick and
satisfying read if you're up for a little horror and a little thrill.
The ending is entirely unexpected, and raises a lot of interesting
points about our identity, perceptions, reality, and the pliability of
the human mind.  I would highly highly recommend it!
