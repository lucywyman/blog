A few months ago I wrote about `my super boring bucket list`_. In
summary, my bucket list does not include seeing the Northern Lights or
skydiving but does include getting married and having kids. Since
writing that list I've started having more exciting ideas for my
bucket list, and when I initially went to edit my Super Boring Bucket
List it felt like adding these new ideas ruined the spirit of the
post. So, instead, I'm writing Bucket List Part 2 to include the more
fun (and more achievable) things I want to do before I die.

* Sing karaoke
* Take a dance class
* Get a massage (I know I will eventually do this, but I keep putting
  it off. I need to stop and just do it)
* Have a crossword published in the New York Times
* Take a photography class (in person!)
