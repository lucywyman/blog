Hello beautiful reader! Summer is upon us, and with long sunny days ahead
you know you'll be tripping to Powell's to pick up some summer reads. 
I wanted to make this a regular reading list with a variety of ficiton
and nonfiction books, and I realized that 90% of my choices were 
biographies or memoirs.  If you're not into them, don't despair! There are
a few fictional masterpieces sprinkled in.

* `The Harry Potter Series`_. Depending on your appetite this series can take
   a while, but I recently re-read the whole series and `loved it`_. Definitely
   worth revisiting if you haven't in a while, or if you've never read them
   to begin with.
* `The Help`_. If you haven't already, you should.
* `Use of Weapons`_. Even if you aren't familiar with the `Culture series`_,
  and don't want to read all 9 books, Use of Weapons is a fantastic stand alone
  novel.  The chapters alternate between going forwards in time and backwards,
  the characters are impossibly rich and well written, and the twist at the
  end will leave you speechless and teary-eyed. Even if you're not a sci-fi
  buff, definitely worth reading.
* `Committed`_, `Big Magic`_, or `Eat, Pray, Love`_. 
  You've definitely heard of the last one, but
  the first is *so much better*. Elizabeth Gilbert is 100% my favorite author,
  my guilty pleasure, my comfort food, and her voice is miraculous. I like her
  non-fiction better than her fiction (just personally, no literary criticism
  here), but anything she writes will definitely lift your day.
* `Furiously Happy`_. I'm not sure if this qualifies as a biography, but it
  seems close enough. I've read *several* comedic ladies biographies (
  `Bossypants`_, `Yes Please`_, `Seriously, I'm Kidding`_, 
  `Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?`_, etc.) and though hilarious and 
  inspiring I find the story often gets lost in the authors trying to be 
  funny. Granted being funny in writing (even in an audiobook) is like marathon
  level hard. But `Jenny Lawson`_ definitely pulls it off in her reading of 
  her second book "Furiously Happy", and includes a lot of personal moments
  that help plebs like me understand mental illness.
* `Still Alice`_. It's so hard to understand living with mental illness, and
  Still Alice paints a vivid picture of life with early onset Alzheimers.
  There were so many points where you think "This could be me, or someone 
  I love", and it gives you real empathy and compassion for those battling
  mental illness. 
* `Orange is the New Black`_. I *love* the show, but it definitely takes 
  a lot of artistic license. Piper's actual experience, though less exciting,
  is fascinating and well-told.
* Anything by `David Sedaris`_. I especially love `Holidays on Ice`_, if you're
  a Sedaris newbie.
* `The Audacity of Hope`_. Perfect for a quick weekend read, Obama's cool
  personal story and charismatic voice make this feel good, palate-cleanser
  sort of book. Remind yourself there's good in the world.
