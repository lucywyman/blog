Happy New Year! January is such a melancholy month, isn't it? The
festivities and gatherings have ended, everyone is back to work and
school, and there are weeks of dark, cold daysÂ¹ ahead of us. So, to get
my mind off my SO's departure I listened to Jessi Klein's `You'll Grow
Out of It`_. I had seen this book splashed across the Powell's 'New +
Recommended' lists, in the hands and Instagram accounts of
celebrities, and even had it on personal recommendation from a friend.
And it could not have come at a better time. Jessi's book is all about
coming of age, but instead of focusing on adolescence she focuses on
her twenties and thirties. From terrible boyfriends, to better
boyfriends, to a fiancee, and finally to her pregnancy and child
rearing, Klein's book was a laugh and a comfort when I needed it most.
As comfortable as my situation is now, thinking about the future
*terrifies* me. How am I going to have kids *and* a career? Do I even
want kids? Do I even want a career? Do I want *this* career? What if
things don't work out with my current SO? What if I can't get
pregnant? Or worse, what if I *ever* get pregnant? Oh god oh god oh
god oh god oh god oh god. I know I'm not alone, that my millennial
peers are worrying the same worries and fearing the same futures. But
it's still so profoundly comforting to hear the journey of someone you
admire. That the best laid plans often go astray, and that *not*
planning can work itself out. That **you will be OK** because Jessi
was OK and she doesn't have this any more figured out than you do.
I highly highly highly recommend this book. It will be a friend to
you, no matter where you are or where you see your life going. It will
get you through those dark January days. 

1 The bright side (ha) is that, because I get into the office before
sunrise and leave after sunset, I don't need to wear sunscreen. Score.
