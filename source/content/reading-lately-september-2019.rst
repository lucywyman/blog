`The Lager Queen of Minnesota`_: 4/5
------------------------------------
*J. Ryan Stradal*

While not quite as enjoyable as Stradal's prior novel, *`Kitchens of the Great
Midwest`_*, this book shares many of it's wonderful, warm, quirky, and
serendipitous qualities. I loved each of the main characters, who are lovely
and kind Midwesterners but also complex and layered people. I love how slowly
their stories unfold, taking time to include important and character-defining
details and telling the story right. I loved the themes and plot, and the
general world that Stradal creates. I highly recommend!

For such a terrible cover, this was a great novel! Tiffy and Leon were both
wonderful characters, and while the plot was a bit predictable it also wasn't
boring, and kept me wanting to read more. I loved how endearing and real both
characters were, and how I was genuinely rooting for them. I thought their
flaws made them human, and I empathized with them both. One of the better
rom-com novels I've read this summer.

`The Bride Test`_: 4/5

I still haven't read the `The Kiss Quotient`_, Hoang's acclaimed first novel,
but somehow this second in the series found it's way to my library playlist
first. I see now why *The Kiss Quotient* was talked about for months! *The
Bride Test* follows Esme Tran as she leaves her mother and small daughter in Ho
Chi Minh city for the opportunity to travel to America to go on a blind date
with a wealthy woman's son. Khai has high-functioning autism, and is initially
cold to Esme's attempts to win his heart. But over the summer, in a sudden plot
twist, they *gasp* fall for each other. Though predictable this book was
charming, and I loved both characters. They were genuinely annoying at times in
a way that was refreshing - they weren't coyly avoiding each other, and there
were no plot devices super obvious plot devices to drive them apart. Their
strife was genuine, and so their affection felt more genuine. I already have
*The Kiss Quotient* on hold as well, and can't wait to read more in this
wonderful series.

`Mariam Sharma Hits the Road`_: 4/5
-----------------------------------

This hit home just how uncool I was in high school. The book centers on three
teenagers, two who are Pakistani Muslim and one who is Indian-Pakistani. The
book explores complex issues in a way that respects their complexity, looking
at it from multiple sides and trying to understand the layers and opinions of
each player. For example one teenager is closeted gay and Muslim, with devout
parents. He grapples with his religion, hating it for making his parents hate
gays but also loving God and finding comfort in the rituals and community. What
I liked most about this book was the perspective it gave me, living the world
of southeast-asian teenagers in the modern age, and the constant daily
expectations and judgments they face from the public and their own community.
It was also a relatively light and fun read, and the friendship between
protagonists is wonderful. An excellent teen adventure book with a little more
weight to it.

`Waiting for Tom Hanks`_: 2/5
-----------------------------
*Kerry Winfrey*

Perhaps this book was always ill-fated for me since...I don't *love* Tom Hanks.
He's a great actor! And I love *Forrest Gump*. I have nothing against the man
personally. But when I think of my favorite actors, particularly those I lust
after, Tom Hanks is pretty low on the list.

Maybe it was Annie's pining for Hanks that felt unbelievable then. Or the fact
that a movie star would fall for a lamer version of Bella Swan, if such a thing
is possible. In the end I only made it maybe 1/3 of the way through before
giving up. It wasn't among the worst books I've ever read, but definitely
wasn't worth my time.

`I Might Regret This`_: 3/5
---------------------------
*Abbi Jacobson*

Having just watched all of "Broad City" this summer, I had no idea Abbi had
written a book until I came across it at Powell's. I liked the book because I
love Abbi, and already care about her as a person. But I don't know that on
it's own it would be a great read. The memoir follows Abbi on a road trip she
took between the 4th and 5th seasons of the show. It's full of classic Abbi
Jacobson humor and overthinking, while also being vulnerable and talking about
her insecurities and fears. It was, on reflection, an excellent balance of
reality and humor, of candor and levity, but for some reason it just didn't
resonate with me. I think I don't empathize with a lot of Abbi's fears, and so
they felt sad and pitying rather than joyous in finding I wasn't alone in those
fears. That said, the book is very well written, and if you do share her
tribulations and enjoy her humor it will be a fantastic read.

`Popular: The Power of Likability in a Status-Obsessed World`_: 3/5
-------------------------------------------------------------------
*Mitch Prinstein*

In this research heavy book, Prinstein advocates that feeling accepted and
acknolwedged by your peers has a lot of positive outcomes, including longer
lifespan, greater professional success, higher reported happiness, etc. He
describes 5 categories of popularity that people fall into: average, accepted,
neglected, rejected, and controversial. While where you fall on this spectrum
is largely based in genetics and early childhood, Prinstein suggests that we
have more control over our standing on the spectrum than we may realize. He
argues that trying to become more likable, as opposed to gaining status via
wealth or power, will win you friends. This was like a very research driven
version of *How to Win Friends and Influence People*, and while it was
interesting I'm not sure I'll remember very much of the book a month from now.
