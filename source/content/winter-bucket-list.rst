I've had a lot of fun writing bucket lists for each season this year
(`summer`_, `fall`_), and for Winter I need some things to look forward to
more than ever. There are tons of fun Portland Christmas things to do, some
of which are traditions with my family that I look forward to each year.
Others on this list are to remind me to have fun, indulge, and enjoy this
beautiful season. I know talking about 'slowing down' and 'self caring' is
cliche and overused at this point, but I do find myself rushing through my
days without pausing to reflect, assess, or just absorb. The Holidays seem
like a good time to, cliche as it is, *slow down*. 

Enough ado, here's what I'm looking forward to doing this season:

☑  Walk down `Peacock Lane`_

☑  Watch the tree light up at Pioneer Square

☐  Decorate a tree

☑  Volunteer

☑  Bake some `cookies`_

☑  Visit Santa

☐  Write Christmas cards for friends and family

☐  Watch Elf

☑  Enjoy some hot chocolate (maybe some `drinking chocolate`_?)

☑  Enjoy a coffee from a local shop

☐  Go to a Christmas Bazaar

☑  Wear a bold lip color at least once
