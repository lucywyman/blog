So many mediocre books this month - I just couldn't find my literary stride. I think I went in
thinking I needed some light, rom-com reading, and realized that to distract from reality required
meatier reading. Live and learn.

`The Song of Achilles`_: 5/5

*Hot*.

This book was glorious - mostly for the steaming gay romance, but also for the epic story and
gorgeous prose. I had the *pleasure* of listening to the audiobook version narrated by Frazer
Douglas, whose voice is so deep and dusky it could be a canyon (and the accent! Wowza). This
"spinoff" of *The Iliad* will be a special treat if you're into Greek history but is just as
compelling if you're not. I only knew the barest outlines of Achilles' story going in and didn't get
lost or bored at all. The book is narrated by - and largely about - Achilles lover Patroclus, who is
a deeply rich and interesting character. Patroclus' own history is much less widely known than
Achilles, so the story is new and interesting while still set in the familiar Trojan War
and traditional Greek mythology. The combination is both personal and historic, tragic and
heroic, and brings a new (to most) perspective to one of the most told stories of all time. I can't
recommend it enough!

athletic, sword fighting

`These Witches Don't Burn`: 4/5

This was everything I wanted *We Ride Upon Sticks* to be: a group of high school witches who save
their small town! I loved the complex female friendships, the endearing and fiery characters, and
the mystery at the center of the book made it hard to put down. If you, like me, are looking for
some light witchcraft in your life ðŸ”® I highly recommend.

**RIYL**: Tarot, Josie and the Pussycats, collecting cool rocks

`Only Mostly Devastated`_: 4/5

Ollie was such a sweetheart! I loved getting to live in the world of this book for a few days.
Ollie's life is hardly easy - his crush is still closeted, his aunt is dying, he's forced to attend
a new school for senior year to be close to said aunt. But Ollie immediately connects with some
wonderful friends at his new school that most would call 'quirky' but I would call 'cool', and the
whole book has a brightly-colored quality to it. This was also one of the books where the characters
were great, but the plot was also fantastic (something I don't usually say). The conflicts weren't
contrived but were human and realistic, and the plot was well-paced and led to great character
growth.  Definitely one of the best YA books I read this year.

**RIYL**: Glee, *An Absolutely Remarkable Thing*,  wearing different socks on each foot

`Writers and Lovers`: 3/5
-------------------------
*Lily King*

What am I missing? This book is so acclaimed, beloved by the masses, and yet I found it boring and
unmoving. It's like a worse version of Stephanie Danler's *Sweetbitter*. The prose is just fine,
the main character is a bit immature, and the love triangle is eye-roll-worthy. Overall the book is
fine in my opinion, but I wish I could see what made it "One of the best books of the year" for so
many other reviewers.

`I Wanna Be Where You Are`_: 3/5
--------------------------------

This was a darling but forgettable YA romance, with cute but relatively untroubled characters and a
fun plot. Chloe wants to be a ballerina, but her mom forbids her from auditioning. So Chloe goes on
a road trip while her mom is away, but her neighbor Eli and his Schnauzer Geezer insist on coming
along. Hijinks ensue! This will definitely not make you want to be a ballerina, but it
will make you want to take a road trip.

`The Wedding Party`_: 3/5
-------------------------
*Jasmine Guillory*

I usually love Guillory's sassy characters and smart pairings, but these two just didn't do it for
me. That hate-to-love trope is one I sure do love to hate.

`Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe`_: 2/5
----------------------------------------------------------------

I honestly feel like something might be wrong with me for not liking this book. Maybe this shows my
callousness, but I just could not sympathize with Aristotle and Dante's disillusionment and angst.
Their philosophical musings felt both immature and unrealistic for teenagers, and their dialogue
felt very forced. I wanted so much to like this book, but ultimately it fell flat for me.

`The Happy Ever After Playlist`_: 2/5
-------------------------------------
*Abby Jimenez*

Bland characters who make *the dumbest* assumptions about each other, and are painfully
heteronormative and tropey. The miscommunications are meant to move the plot along but are
impossible to sympathize with, making them more annoying than compelling. I gave up about halfway
through.
