Summer is still a few weeks away, but with Memorial Day behind us I'm already
dreaming of days spent in a park, beside a pool, or on a beach with a good
book in hand. Here's what I've been reading + loving:

`Kitchens of the Great Midwest`_
--------------------------------
*By J. Ryan Stradal*

Kitchens of the Great Midwest is just about the sweetest book.
Following the life of Eva Thorvald through the eyes of those around her,
this book details the joys and pains of growing up in the midwest. Filled
with food and a kindness only midwesterners can muster, KotGM is the
perfect compliment to sunshine and lazy days in the park.

----------------------------------------------------------------
*By Rosa Brooks*

Despite it's tongue-twisting title, `How Everything Became War, and
the Military Became Everything`_ might be the best book I read all
year. The military has never been part of my family or culture, yet as
an American has tremendous impact on my life. A former Pentagon
reporter, Rosa Brooks brings incredible insight into the current state
of the military, and how it got to where it is. What influence does it
yield? Why? What are the consequences of that? I learned *so much*
reading this book, and like all the best books it gave me new
perspective and understanding of the world we live in.

`The Magnolia Story`_
---------------------
*By Chip and Joanna Gaines*

I know I know I know I know I know. Judge all you want, I am
head-over-heels for Chip and Joanna Gaines, and their book did not
disappoint. They're so funny! And cute!  Perfect for beach reading and
flower gazing.

`The Bell Jar`_
---------------
*By Sylvia Plath*

The Bell Jar flat out surprised me. I think of it as Classic Literature,
and often find that Classic Literature is too masculine or too opaque for
my casual reading tastes. This book was anything but! Plath's
semi-autobiographical novel is the beautiful story of a young woman trying
to find her

`Beautiful Ruins`_
------------------
*By Jess Walter*

It's hard to conceive of a book that successfully explores so many characters,
time periods, locations, and relationships in a cohesive story. But Walter is
able to take us from the Italian coast in the 1960's to modern day Hollywood to
the middle of nowhere Idaho without muddling the story or confusing the reader.
Rich characters, interesting plot, and Hollywood glamour make this a delightful
read.
