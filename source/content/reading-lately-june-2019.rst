`Can't Escape Love`_
--------------------
*Alyssa Cole*

When you can't count on anyone else, count on Alyssa Cole to write a *fucking
amazing* romance novel. Each one is better than the last! Her characters are so
layered, complex, and real. Conflict doesn't arise from unrealistic
miscommunication or quixotic drama, but from interesting character dynamics and
real-world issues. I can't wait for the next one to come in at the library.

`With the Fire on High`_

This was such a refreshing and smart YA read. I loved the voice and
confidence of Emoni, and loved how real the story, conflicts, and
characters were. It didn't feel overdone or dramatic, and it was
unexpected yet realistic how casual Emoni was about having a baby, and
how much she loved her baby. Highly recommended for young adults and
old adults alike!

`The Garden Party`_
-------------------

*The Garden Party* reminded me of Gabriel Garcia-Marquez' *100 Years of
Solitude* in terms of it's atmosphere and eccentricity. The book is dreamy and
fantastic, firmly in reality but just at the edge of it, and I liked that it
was electric without veering into zaniness. Despite liking the vibe of the
book, I'll admit I started to get a bit lost in jumping between conversations,
and gave up entirely on it when it came due at the library maybe 3/4 of the way
through. If you liked *A Mid-Summer Night's Dream* or *100 Years of Solitude*,
you'd like this modern tale too.

`Outer Order, Inner Calm`_
--------------------------
*Gretchen Rubin*

Gretchen Rubin seems like such a happy, lovely person, and I enjoy reading and
listening to her just for a dose of happy-go-lucky. That said I find I never I
actually follow her advice. I thought this book would make me want to purge and
clean, but instead found that I was already pretty happy with the state of my
posessions - probably because we had just moved, so had already "Kondo'd" our
things. I gave up halfway through in pursuit of more interesting reads (per
`Gretchen's own advice`_!), but if you like Gretchen as I do then you'll like
her latest research project.

`Accidental Beauty Queen`_
--------------------------
*Teri Wilson*

This book *hit the spot*. It was so cute and fun without being too sugary or
saccharine, with great characters and interesting conflict (if a bit crazy). If
you liked *Miss Congeniality*, *Legally Blonde*, or *The Princess Diaries*,
this is the perfect beach read.

`Long Shot`_
------------
*Kennedy Ryan*

I was not ready for the intensity and emotional depth of this book. What I
thought would be yet another romance novel was a fantastic novel about the
reality of abuse, and in particular being abused by a famous professional
athlete. Time and again athletes get a mere slap on the wrist for abusing their
partners, and this book highlights just how powerless both physically and
socially those partners are. Don't get me wrong - there were also plenty of
great sex scenes with a non-abusive partner, and a lot of the typical
over-simplification of emotions and sex that romance novels are known for. But
this book gave me a better understanding of what abuse victims suffer, and as
terrible as this sounds an appreciation for the men in my life. If you like
Colleen Hoover, or want a typical romance novel with way more grit and
emotional twists, then this is for you.

`Field Notes on Love`_
----------------------
*Jennifer E. Smith*

After an intense read this was a refreshing palate cleanser. I'll use the back-of-the-book summary:
.. line-block::

  Having just been dumped by his girlfriend, British-born Hugo is still
  determined to take his last-hurrah-before-college train trip across the
  United States. One snag: the companion ticket is already booked under the
  name of his ex, Margaret Campbell. Nontransferable, no exceptions.

  Enter the new Margaret C. (Mae for short), an aspiring filmmaker with big
  dreams. After finding Hugo's spare ticket offer online, she's convinced
  it's the perfect opportunity to expand her horizons

This was a whimsical and adorable coming-of-age, young-love story. It was fun
without feeling meaningless, and captured that summer-crush teenage-romance
feeling without feeling overly romanticized (high school wasn't *that* great).
Highly recommend if you're looking for a quick and fluffy read.

`Ayesha at Last`_
-----------------
*Uzma Jalaluddin*

This book helped me realize how intolerant I am of religion - almost certainly
too intolerant. I like to think of myself as 'live-and-let-live', and I would
*never* tell anyone else what to believe or how to be. But listening to the
thoughts of truly devout people was uncomfortable, and I found it took a lot of
character development for me to like the more religious characters. Because of
this, and because of the portrayal of modern struggle between religion and
culture and modernity, I thought this was a great book. Ayesha is a strong and
likable character, and while I wasn't rooting for her love interest I was
rooting for her, which kept me hooked. A great combination vegetable-candy book
(or as I like to think, a fruit book), you'll like this one if you liked
*Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows* or *Bend it Like Beckham*. In fact....I
think I'd recommend you just read *Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows* instead.
