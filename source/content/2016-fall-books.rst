Hello fellow humans! Fall is here, in case you hadn't noticed yet, and
with rainy Sundays and long bus rides to school ahead it's time to
pick up some easy reads. Make some tea, cozy up, and crack a book!
Here's what I've been reading and loving:

`The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo`_ by Amy
Schumer. Not just
another comedian's memoir, Amy's book offers fascinating insight into
how she became the person (and celebrity) she is today.  With
heartbreaking stories and a sprinkling of levity, this might be my
favorite read of the year to date.  You can read more of my thoughts
on the book `here`_.

`American Housewife`_ by Helen Ellis.  This is a quirky yet
relatable collection of short stories about what it means to be a
modern woman.  My favorite story was hands down The Fitter, but each
is a gem unto itself.  Want to know what it's about? You know how to
find out.

`Hunger Makes Me a Modern Girl`_ by Carrie Brownstein. True to form
I love me a good memoir, and Carrie's was the perfect scratch
for my itch. Like Amy Schumer's memoir, HMMaMG is raw and
unapologetic, describing some of the hardest parts of her life and
how she came to be the person she is today.

`When Breath Becomes Air`_ by Paul Kalanithi. I didn't know much
about this book going in, but was stunned by the eloquence and voice
of Paul's writing. His story is interesting and deeply sad, and I
found myself crying on the way to class at the end. Definitely a
short but worthwhile read.

`The Assistants`_ by Camille Perri. Part office gossip, part juicy
crime novel, I couldn't read this book fast enough.  I loved Camille's
characters, the genius (and not contrived) story, the setting and
conflicts and intimacies of people we work with.

`Shrill`_ by Lindy West. A reminder that we are all human beings, and
that we need to treat each other accordingly. But told really, really
well. Seriously, just read it, and become the better person you know
you can be.

That's it!  Happy reading beautiful people, and as always feel free to

become ugly places on the internet. I'm not saying *you* would write
anything terrible, but it just felt like asking for trouble. You can
always reach out to me via email!
