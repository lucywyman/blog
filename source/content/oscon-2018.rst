OSCON 2018 is officially in the books, and I have to say this one was
a stand out. A combination of career advancement (read: getting
smarter), gaining experience, and having a number of contacts old and
new at the conference made it a particularly great experience. I've
gotten to the point where I'm better at choosing talks that are
relevant to my field, and I have context to learn from them but don't
know enough to get nothing from them. This is all a long way of saying
that I have a lot of meaningful takeaways from this conf and can start
applying to my work immediately, as well as a lot of great experiences
reconnecting with old friends and solidifying my relationship with new
ones!

TL;DR: Videos won't be available for 3-4 weeks, but when they are I
highly recommend:

* `Building Your Own Cryptocurrency`_ for understanding how fiat
  currency works, and what that means for cryptocurrency
* `Istio`_ for understanding what Istio is and how it works
* `GRPC vs. REST`_ for an entertaining comparison of REST and gRPC

Here's a play-by-play rundown of the last 2 days:

Day 1 Keynotes
--------------

`Live Coding: OSCON Edition`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Suz Hinton*

This talk was so inspiring! Once I started working I stopped playing
with technology as much, and trying new things just for the fun of it.
So what if I'm not building something useful? What if we just built
things for fun, to learn? I used to do this often on the weekends
during university, and feel I've lost that sense of adventure and
curiosity since I started working. I have a dusty arduino at the house
that I've been uninspired to build something with. This talk inspired
me to just start *playing* with it, and not worry about if it was
useful in the end.

`Recognizing Cultural Bias in AI`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Camille Eddy*

I'm embarrassed to admit I've never considered that AI would inherit
our human biases, or how that would impact marginalized groups. Eddy
told the story of `MIT researcher Joy Buolamwini`_, who wasn't
recognized by the facial recognition AI she was developing until she
wore a white mask, to demonstrate how our own biases and inequalities
translate to the tools we develop. This talk reenergized me to
continue working toward a more diverse tech industry, and to continue
advocating for diversity and inclusion.

`Open source and open standards in the age of cloud AI`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Tim O'Reilly*

O'Reilly reaffirmed and expanded on Eddy's talk, discussing how
algorithms and AI impact who gets what and why. It was really about
how open standards, open data, and community are the backbone of
successful technology, and how new technical industries like AI and
cloud computing will need to embrace and serve their communities
rather than shut them out.

`Introduction to Blockchains`_
------------------------------
*By ME*

This was my talk! I won the scheduling lottery being assigned the
first timeslot on the first day. The room was packed with people, and
everyone was engaged and excited to learn about cool math! I'll be
totally honest: most of the time when I finish a talk I pick it apart
and dwell on what I could have done better. While this talk definitely
wasn't *perfect*, I'm genuinely really proud of my delivery. I can
tell my public speaking style is improving and that practicing this
talk early and often paid off. I felt very in control of the
talk and the audience, and capable of answering any questions. All in
all, a talk I'm excited to give again!

`Mary Had a Little Lambda`_
---------------------------
*Anjana Vakil*

I think I knew too much going into this talk. I know I just wrote
about how I'm getting better at choosing talks, and that's because
this is the only talk I felt overqualified for. A review of lambda
functions it turns out I didn't need.

`TL;DR: NIST Container Security Standards`_
-------------------------------------------
*Elsie Philips and Paul Burt*

A brief overview of the NIST container security standards, or how to
keep your containers secure. I'll admit I didn't get much new
information from this talk, but it was great to see a friend from
university and some entertaining memes.

`Building Your Own Cryptocurrency`_
-----------------------------------
*John Feminella*

This talk was *amazing*. Feminella talked about how "real" currency
(dollars and euros) work, and what features of those currencies
cryptocurrencies will need to have in order to succeed. I'd consider
myself financially literate in a practical sense, but I never learned
about fiat currency or thought about what gives money value. It's
always been an "it just is" kind of thing for me. It was awesome to
step back and think about money as having features, and what those
features might look like for cryptos. I don't invest very much in
cryptos, but it was also a very sobering reality check amongst a lot
of hype. Highly recommend giving this a watch if you're interested in
how money works or how viable cryptos are!

Day 2 Keynotes
--------------

`O'Reilly Radar: Open Source Tool Trends`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Roger Magoulas*

An interesting dive into search term data on the O'Reilly website (I
think Safari specifically). I don't think there were any great
surprises: 

* Python, Java, and Javascript are the most popular languages
* Kubernetes, Go, and Blockchain are gaining popularity
* Rust has stagnated, at least in number of people searching for it

All interesting affirmations in data of things we already knew.

`Coding a Blockchain`_
----------------------
*Josh Butikofer*

One of the tracks this year was 'Live Coding', and I was admittedly
skeptical going in. I wasn't sure how interesting it would be to watch
someone code, or how deep you could go writing code in 40 minutes. It
turns out it's an *awesome* format (also Josh is super good at it!).
Live coding was a perfect middle ground between reading code (which
results in little absorption of the material) and trying to write code
yourself (which requires a much bigger time investment and can be
confusing and frustrating). Having a relative expert walk you through
what they were writing, why, and then *seeing it in code* was super
helpful for solidifying my understanding of blockchains. While this
talk was a direct subset of topics I covered in my own talk, I found
watching someone write it live valuable. Highly recommend this talk as
well!

`Istio: Weaving, Securing, and Observing Your Microservices`_
-------------------------------------------------------------
*Daniel Berg*

I first heard about Istio at `DevOps Days PDX`_ last year, and didn't
understand it at all. While I've had it explained a few times since,
this talk was a real 'Aha' moment for me. Berg clearly explains, with
great visuals and simple language, what Istio is, what it can be used
for, and gives us a tour of it's features. As a member of the devops
community (if not a devops engineer) it will be so helpful to have a
basic understanding of Istio going forward. Not the most riveting
talk, but definitely one I got a lot out of.

`GRPC vs. REST`_
----------------
*Alex Borysov and Mykyta Protsenko*

Possibly the most entertaining talk of OSCON 2018, this talk discussed
the differences between REST and gRPC for API construction. I learned
that gRPC is an actual library as opposed to an architectural pattern,
and that it's ideal for performant, asynchronous APIs. A great
deep-dive that I'd like to re-watch once it's out, as in-person I was
pretty mentally exhausted by that point :)
