It's been a while since I did a book roundup, and honestly that's
because I had a rather unlucky streak of uninspiring books. It wasn't
that these were "bad" books, but they just weren't the type of books
that felt worth sharing. `The Commitment` by Dan Savage is the perfect
example: while I enjoy Savage's writing, this was a *long* book where
Savage tries to convince the (presumably liberal) reader that same-sex
marriage should be legal. Either you agree with him and gain nothing
from the book, or you disagree with him and only make it 2 pages in.
I didn't regret reading it, but definitely didn't think it was worth
writing about. `The Never-Open Desert Diner`_ is another good example:
it was perfectly enjoyable but kind of weird and I don't know that I
would say I recommend it? It was pretty far outside of my typical
literary diet, and while it was great to step out of my comfort zone
I'd feel dishonest encouraging others to read it. 

But! Things have turned around. I've read a number of great books over
the course of February and March, and have finally compiled enough to
warrant a post. I'm a few days past the 'Spring Reads' deadline, but
we'll call it Spring Reads anyway ;) Here's what I've been enjoying
lately:

`The Muse`_
-----------
*Jessie Burton*

This book took me by surprise, and was such a delight! It's a clever
story with wonderfully complex characters, and who create great
tension and conflict with each other. It's so hard to write characters
who are all likeable and empathetic but still create believable
conflict, and Jessie Burton nailed it. A bit of a long one, but worth
every hour!

`The Grownup`_
--------------
*Gillian Flynn*

A half-step closer to horror than `Gone Girl`_, this short story by
Gillian Flynn proves "Gone Girl" was no fluke. It's impossible to tell
what's true, who's lying, and what really happened. Strong female
lead, plot twists I never saw coming, and an open ending make this a
story that you'll keep thinking about long after putting it down.
Highly recommend!

`Lily and the Octopus`_
-----------------------
*Stephen Rowley*

I read this because it was the `Girly Book Club's`_ March read, and I
have mixed feelings about it. It's an unusual and heart-wrenching
read, but I didn't feel like it brought anything new to the
sad-book-about-a-dying-dog genre of books. The book follows Ted as he
grapples with the inevitable death of his beloved companion, a
dachshund named Lily. It was honestly hard to empathize with Ted, and
while there's no wrong way to grieve it was hard to be in the mind of
someone who is so lonely and who's only friend is a dying dog. At the
same time, it has rich descriptions, great characters, and is
excellent at making Lily a character as much as Ted. So...a mixed bag.
Read at your own risk.

`Call Me By Your Name`_
-----------------------
*Andr√© Aciman*

This is my favorite book ever. Period. The best movie, and the best
book. Elio is so expressive and emotional. As I've gotten older I
think I've lost touch with that emotional side of myself, for better
or worse. Especially in America I think it's typical to numb yourself
in order to 'get through' everyday life, and we quickly forget what
it's like to feel much of anything very strongly. "Call Me By Your
Name" reminds me to not be afraid of feeling too much, to be
vulnerable and present and that even the lows have a certain richness
to them when you really *feel* them. I love the setting, I love the
story, I love the characters. I want to live in the world and the
character that Aciman has created everyday, and am glad that for at
least a few hours this week I was able to escape to that place. This
is definitely a read that I'll keep coming back to.
