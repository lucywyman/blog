For the sake of recalling more from the books I read, and avoiding homework,
I plan to start reviewing the books I read (or, rather, listen to). 
I'm currently making my way through the Harry Potter series again, but in 
the meantime got a chance to read `Ready Player One by Ernest Cline`_.  Set 
30 years in the future, Ready Player One depicts a bleak distopia where 
a MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role playing game) called the OASIS 
is the only escape from reality, and has in fact replaced it.  The novel 
follows teenager Wade Watts through a Hunger Games-esque competition 
requiring expansive and detailed knowledge of 80's tech culture, from 
video games to movies to comic books and beyond.  This is a total candy
read, and if you're into science fiction or Neal Stephenson novels 
(particularly `Reamde`_), this 
would definitely be a good weekend pick-me-up.  

Personally, it didn't hit my literary sweet spot, but then again I can't 
say I expected it to. I will say it was much more accessible than I expected 
it to be, and aligned perfectly with my values: intellect winning out over
money; strong, rich, diverse characters; well researched but not obscure. 
Candy Read.  Without giving too much away (fear not, read on), what made 
it most enjoyable was the very distinct Good vs. Evil dynamic, and how 
each party was very clearly on one side or the other. It was easy to root 
for the the protagonists, against the antagonists, and just be along for 
the plot-ride.  

And that's all she wrote.  My next review will be sometime next week on
Carrie Brownstein's memoir `Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl`_.
