The `Tournament of Books`_ happened this month, and while I knew I
wouldn't get through all the books I did try for as many as I could
that were available at the library. This resulted in a slow month with
a lot of 'vegetable reads' - novels that I think are good for me, as I
wouldn't normally read them and they broaden my horizons. It was also
a great reminder of why I don't read books strictly based on acclaim
very often. A few gems were found though: let's get into it.

`Warlight`_

This isn't usually the type of book I'd pick up, and honestly
reminded me why I don't read 'artsy' books as much. While I can see
the appeal of Ondaatje's ethereal settings, elusive characters, and
vivid setting descriptions, it's weird to dedicate so many words to
the strange details of a story (the dog race scene? What?) instead of
the plot or characters. I suppose that's the appeal - it just isn't
for me. Ultimately a good book, and good to get out of my comfort
zone, but I won't be coming back.

`Census`_
---------

Ha! And I thought 'Warlight' was artsy. 'Census' was way too abstract
for a casual reader such as myself. While I wouldn't say this was a
'bad' book, and the Author's Note provided some much-needed and heart
wrenching context, it was not for me.

`The Italian Teacher`_
----------------------

This was by far my favorite of the ToB reads. I loved Pinch's
complicated relationship with both of his parents, and how that shaped
so much of his life. It captured so well how desperate we are to be
shown love by our parents, who are supposed to love us
unconditionally. How despite being rejected and ignored and
unsupported repeatedly by his father, Pinch still longs for his
acceptance even at the cost of success in other areas of his life. I
loved how messy Pinch's life was, how each event made sense on it's
own but together created a story that felt unlikely and wild. If you
like stories about family dynamics, coming of age, or the art world,
this one is for you.

`Surprise Me`_
--------------
*Sophie Kinsella*

I was (appropriately) surprised by how much I liked this book! I
expected it to be a meaningless fling of a book, the kind of thing you
read when there's nothing else to read. The depth of the heroine's
character, the plot twists and gut wrenches in her story, and the
relatable setting all made this a very enjoyable read! I wouldn't go
so far as to say I loved it, or it changed my life or anything. I'm
not even sure I'd recommend it. But I would definitely not discourage
people from reading it, and hope you'll also find it entertaining.

`Remedial Rocket Science`_
--------------------------
*Susannah Nix*

As a lady software engineer, I thought a romance novel with this title
could not disappoint. Apparently I learned nothing from 'Big Bang
Theory': tech-themed media is *so hard* to get right. While the
technical details of the book are pretty good, the characters fall
totally flat. The heroine gives all appearance of being a 'strong
female lead', then ends up falling for a guy who's clearly beneath
her? I didn't really get it - Jeremy was a mostly-loser, and she could
have done *way* better. Skip this sorry feminist-wannabe.

`The Parking Lot Attendant`_
----------------------------
*Nafkote Tamirat*

The last of my ToB reads, I think it's most telling that my library
loan expired halfway through reading this and I didn't renew it.
Like 'Census' it wasn't a *bad* book (will I ever say a book is a bad
book?), but I didn't feel invested in any of the characters. I didn't
understand the charm of the main hero, who hypnotizes an entire
community into doing his bidding, or the sense of loyalty the leading
lady felt for him. It was hard to care about what happened to anyone,
and - I can't believe I'm saying this - focused way too much on the
character dynamics and not enough on the plot. It was hard to
understand what was happening from such a narrow perspective, and I
admittedly can't read between the lines. Overall, this book was just a
bit confusing and not all that interesting.
