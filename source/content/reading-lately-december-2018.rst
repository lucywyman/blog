Despite the cold, I *love* December. Or rather, I love Christmas
season. The lights! The trees! The time with family! It feels like a
time to pause, reflect on the year, absorb the beauty around us, and
be with the people we love. Plus there's so much time for reading! 

This month was mostly meh, with several books that were enjoyable
enough to see through but that I wouldn't necessarily recommend. I
*loved* "Eleanor Oliphant", despite having put it down halfway through
6 months ago, but other than that I can't honestly rave about any of
my other reads. So, I suppose this is a list for is you have
absolutely nothing better to read. HAHAHA as if that ever happens.

Here's to starting off the new year with better books!

`Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine`_

Definitely my favorite read this month, I put "Eleanor Oliphant" down
last May, deciding I didn't care for the protagonist or plot. If only
I had read 50 more pages! I won't give away any spoilers, but will
only say that you should power through at least 1/2 the book before
giving up on it. More is revealed about Eleanor that makes her a much
more palatable character, and by the end you'll be literally crying
for her. At first it seems like a book about a stuck-up loner with a
horrible mother, but later you'll find themes of loneliness,
judgement, depression, and trauma. A must read!

`If You Come Softly`_

I read this as part of John Green's `Life's Library`_ project, and
have mixed feelings. It's short enough that I'd consider worth the
investment of time and energy, and I wholeheartedly understand and
endorse it's status as an important book which has remained remarkably
relevant for 20 years now. I may not have liked it, but it was a good
book for me to read and reflect on. I also liked that the focus wasn't
*just* about race, but that both characters were complex and layered,
and race was just one part of their multi-faceted identity. I know the
book is based on "Romeo and Juliet", but it was a little hard to get
over the love-at-first-sight thing, and felt the use of poetry was
heavy-handed. It made the book unnecessarily angsty, and distracted
from the prose. Lastly I *hated* the end. I'll try not to spoil it
here, but it felt like an attempt to "save" the book or give it more
meaning than it could have otherwise. While realistic, it felt like a
way of avoiding writing more character development, and actually
following through on the protagonists relationship. Ok, dangerously
close to spoilers, so that's all I'll say.

`A Princess in Theory`_

This was nearly the perfect romance novel. The smart, capable heroine!
The sensitive, supportive hero! SHE PEES AFTER SEX TO AVOID A UTI! I
really enjoyed this book - the plot was interesting and exciting, the
characters were endearing, and it addressed social issues particularly
around sex head on. The perfect modern romance, if you ask me!

`Sisterland`_
-------------
*Curtis Sittenfeld*

Honestly, I wouldn't recommend this book. I made it to the end, and it
was good enough that I wanted to know what happened, but there's much
better literature and characters out there (`Eligible`_ by the same
author being a good example!). My main complaint is that the narrator
doesn't abide by a set of principles, and while I think there's a
place for flawed narrators and protagonists this one was *so annoying*
and spineless. She doesn't take her family's best interests into
account, and reveals herself to be selfish and weirdly obstinate on
certain issues while flexible on others. I was too far in by the time
all this happened to put the book down, but I honestly have no
sympathy for her.

`Shakespeare: The World as Stage`_
----------------------------------

I read this before giving to my dad as a Christmas present, and was
surprised and delighted by how entertaining it was. It attempts to
examine Shakespeare's life, but because so little is known about him
ends up being more about the time-period and context he lived in. I
don't generally care for history, but thought this was fascinating and
at time hilarious. Who knew the Puritans living in Elizabethan England
were so wily? Or that a rival theater group literally *stole a
theater* and rebuilt the building on the other side of the river?
Highly recommend this short and fun read!
