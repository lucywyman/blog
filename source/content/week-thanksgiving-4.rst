This is the fourth post of my `Thanksgiving Week`_ series. If you
haven't already, I'd recommend reading the `introduction post`_ first!

I've spent far, far too much of my life thinking about my body.  Is it
thin enough, pretty enough, good enough? As if that's any reflection
of me as a person. But for all of that obsession I rarely took time
to appreciate all of the things my body is capable of, and how
*valuable* my health is. It requires a lot of maintenance (was 8
hours of sleep really necessary, evolution?), but having a healthy
body lets me focus on living and experiencing and enjoying.  I can
spend hours hiking, eat most foods, and take care of myself entirely
on my own. I don't need to take a pill in the morning, or worry about
whether a restaurant will have something that's safe for me to eat.
And I'm able-bodied, a privilege I take entirely for granted which
influences how others see and treat me. My body
is the vessel I live in, my home, my rock, and it's been a damn good
one at that. For that, I'm grateful.
