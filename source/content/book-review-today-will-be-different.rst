Off the Powell's New + Recommended shelf, I picked up `Today Will
Be Different`_ by Maria Semple. And unfortunately, it won't be finding
it's way to my 'New + Recommended' list any time soon. The book
follows Eleanor through a particularly whirl-wind day, from her son
Timby feigning illness to her husband becoming an unexpected
Christian. It was charming and short, definitely a decent mindless
read to have on as background noise. Though the main character,
Eleanor, was entertaining I didn't find that I connected with her very
much, or particularly cared what happened to her. That's more on me
than the novel -- she's a nuanced and well-formed character, a mildly
neurotic housewife doing her best amid the mess that is Life, who I
think a lot of people *will* resonate with.  I just didn't. But beyond
that, the book was honestly boring. Boring books aren't always bad,
they can keep you company and fill the space between more grandiose
cousins. But at the end of the day there's nothing memorable, lasting,
or insightful about the book. If you're looking for something to pick
up this isn't the first thing I'd recommend, but it's not the worst
choice either.  It's the 'meh' choice.
