About me

:slug: about

Hello!  I'm a Quality Assurance Engineer for Puppet Labs, where I automate tests and develop testing
infrastructure.  I graduated from Oregon State University with a BS in Computer
Science in June 2016, where I also worked as a Front-End Engineer for the OSU
Open Source Lab. I specialize in web development and am proficient in HTML,
Sass/CSS, Javascript and Python, as well as C/C++, Ruby, and Haskell. In addition,
I'm a Body Pump Instructor. In my spare time I enjoy spending time with friends, watching TV, hiking, cooking, loving, and living.
