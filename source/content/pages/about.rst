Hello, and welcome to my humble blog! I write mostly about the books I
read, the adventures I go on, and the things in life I'm enjoying. In
real life I'm a software engineer for `Puppet`_, where I'm currently
working on our open source remote task runner `Bolt`_. I graduated from
Oregon State University with a BS in Computer Science in June 2016,
where I worked as a Front-End Engineer for the OSU Open Source Lab. In
my free time I enjoy hanging out with friends, hiking, experiencing
new things, and enjoying a wide variety of podcasts, tv shows, blogs,
books, and other media.
