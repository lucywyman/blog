About me
========
:slug: about

I'm a Quality Assurance Engineer for Puppet Labs, where I automate
tests and develop testing infrastructure for puppet orchestrator, PCP,
and PE core.  I graduated from Oregon State University with a BS in
Computer Science in June 2016, where I worked as a Front-End Engineer
for the OSU Open Source Lab.  In my free time I enjoy hanging out with
friends, hiking, experiencing new things, and enjoying a wide variety
of podcasts, tv shows, blogs, books, and other media.
