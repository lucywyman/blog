Places
~~~~~~

`Kubota Garden`_
----------------

Kubota is an incredible and unexpected oasis in the heart of south
Seattle. It's about a 20 minute walk from our house, and we spent a
long time getting lost looking for it the first time we went. We
entered hoping it'd be worth the trouble, and it was as if we'd left
this world. The noise of traffic falls away, and the garden is lush
with green lawns, exotic trees, and blooms of every color, and it
seemed too bright and vibrant to be real. It was like walking into a movie set
where they had turned the hues and brightness just a little bit too
high. I can't recommend finding your way to Kubota garden enough,
especially in spring and summer.

`Ark Lodge Theater`_
--------------------

The local theater of your dreams, Ark Lodge is located in Columbia
City (aka the cutest neighborhood in south Seattle). With a grocery
store across the street, a quickly rotating mix of indie and
mainstream releases, and enough screens to show 4-5 movies at a time,
we've loved going to Ark Lodge just about every weekend since we moved
here. The staff is *incredibly* friendly, the seats are comfy, the
retro ads from the 80's are hilarious, and the special events (we saw
Back to the Future there in June) are so much fun! If you ever need to
see a movie in Seattle, see it here!

`Uwajimaya`_
------------

I know Uwajimaya isn't exclusive to Seattle, but it's much more
centrally located than the Uwajis in Beaverton, and at least from the
inside seems bigger. Uwajimaya is a huge Japanese grocer, with all
manner of exotic goods. It's the kind of place you could easily spend
hours in finding new candies, comics, snacks, drinks, sushi, and
miscellany from Japan and East Asia.

`MoPop`_
--------

The Museum of Pop (formerly Experience Music Project) is the most
underrated tourist attraction in Seattle. I'd never heard about or
seen it before coming to the city, yet the building itself is *the
most* insta-worthy and the museum itself is interesting and fun for
everyone, no matter how old or "not into museums" you are. They have
an interactive indie video game exhibit where you can play one of
dozens of indie games. They have horror-movie and sci-fi exhibits
where you can learn about the origins of your favorite characters and
tropes. And they're special exhibits are always fun as well; recently
they had a Marvel Comics exhibit that included original art, the
evolution of comics, and life-sized figures to take pictures with.
It's a bit expensive, but worth the price of admission.

`Ada's Technical Books`_
------------------------

It's a good thing I don't live closer to Ada's, or I'd be broke.
Imagine a small, lovely bookstore dedicated mostly to technical
manuals, non-fiction tomes, and books to satisfy your every curiosity.
What I love about Ada's is how welcoming it is - like walking into
your grandma's house and smelling freshly baked cookies, if your
grandma was an insatiably curious engineer. It's a wonderfully unique
space!

Food

`Geraldine's`_
--------------

We went to Geraldine's one of the first weekends Eli was in Seattle
(before I had even moved up), and immediately felt better about our
impending move north. Geraldine's is the classic diner every town,
city, and neighborhood in America needs. They have delicious,
non-greasy, classic American breakfast and lunch food. Geraldine's is
the perfect place for groups and family gatherings since they're bound
to have something everyone will like, and have a great atmosphere (if
you're not sure what to get, definitely go for the bacon, egg, and
arugula sandwich and get it with avocado. It's my favorite sandwich
*in the world*).  Just be sure to get there early Saturdays and
Sundays! Or else you might have to browse the adorable shops lining
the street Geraldine's resides on while you wait for a table ;)

`Columbia City Bakery`_
-----------------------

Right across the street from Geraldine's is Columbia City Bakery, the
hands-down best bakery I've been to. They have classic and modern
baked goods, from sourdoughs and baguettes to Gougeres (imagine if a
croissant and a cheezit had a baby - you *must* get one) and Columbia
Super Chip cookies (at least 80% chocolate chips by volume). I love
the variety of their goods, the friendly community they've created
around the bakery, and most of all the unbeatable quality! My go-to
place for a pick-me-up, and the first place I'd recommend you go if
you're in town.

`Portage Bay Cafe`_
-------------------

Portage Bay Cafe is our 'fancy breakfast place'. Instead of going on
about how much I like their food, I'll tell two interesting stories I
have that are set at Portage Bay. The first is that Eli and I went
there for Easter this year, and got to try a *rabbit omelet*. To some
this may seem tame, but to us city-dwellers it was very exciting. Not
to be cliche, but it honest to god tasted like chicken.

The other interesting story: every year we go to `Bumbershoot`_, a
music festival in Seattle. Last year Eli and I ordered our tickets
separately, and Bumbershoot accidentally sent me *two* tickets instead
of one! At first I thought I had ordered 2 instead of 1, and was
bummed to have wasted the money. But it turned out we just got a free
ticket! I sold it, and we took friends out to Portage Bay and gorged
our selves on $130 of brunch food, and *exorbitant* amount for our
frugal, college-age selves.

So...it may not be free, and they may not have rabbit when you go, but
trust me it's a great place for brunch!
