Another year of `Write the Docs`_!  Although I don't write as much
documentation as I should, writing is such a key part of day-to-day human
interaction, and WTD is always a good reminder of basic principles and
encouragement to write more (docs).  It's also an incredibly well run
conference, done through trial and error. Every year they try new things, and
keep the things that work.  It's also one-track, which has pros and cons.

**Pros**: 
* Everyone has the same experience, and it's easy to discuss
* You don't need to make any decisions or miss great talks

**Cons**:
* You have to sit through some sub-optimal talks
* Less walking and time between sessions

WTD is also held at the `Crystal Ballroom`_ in Portland, which is a great
venue.  It's friendly. It's not corporate-y. Good vibes all around. There were
also talks. I wrote about them.

**Side Note:** There were many well-dressed humans, who had very well designed
[clothes | bags | accessories]. It was wonderful to get out of the university
fashion bubble.

Day 1
#####

Open Source Docs in Federal Gov't
---------------------------------

**Britta Gustafson**

Contributing to `government software`_ was a thought that had never crossed my
mind, and it turns out that not *all* the governments software is horrible and
outdated.  In fact, they have a lot of really cool and interesting APIs, and
are incredibly immersed in Open Source.  Britta recently became a federal
employee, working for the `General Services Agency (GSA)`_ on the `18F`_, and
she gave a compelling talk on why contributing to the government helps you help
others.  We often think of the government as a crufty old gross thing that
takes our money and makes bad decisions. But if we want that to change, we
*have the power*, especially as software developers. Being part of that
ecosystem can help strengthen a weak and imperfect system, and do good for a
lot of people. All good things to think about, and really a core part of open
source. Great talk, great speaker, great topic.

Customer Support + Docs
-----------------------

**Neal Kaplan**

This was a rough talk. It can really be summed up in one sentence: If you write
docs, you should talk to your customers and customer support team more to get a
feel for what customers need and what your docs are missing.  A good point, but
not a half-hour long point. 

Documenting APIs
----------------

**Allison Reinheimer Moore**

Allison's talk was well put together and well-rehearsed, but without many 
memorable takeaways. APIs are so diverse that this is an understandably 
difficult talk to execute, and I recall it being unfortunately general.

Collaboration Between Open Source + Corporate Software
------------------------------------------------------

**Shaun McCance**

Shaun's talk was primarily a call to action for professional technical writers
to help the open source projects they use write good documentation. Often
community members are working on open source projects just for fun, and most
developers don't find writing docs very fun. Understandably. So, as paid people
who use words, if you're already writing docs for something, why not contribute
that to open source?  It strengthens both products, makes the world better,
unicorns poop rainbows, yay.  This was another talk that could really have been
5 minutes of "Hey, here's a thought you might not have had, do the things!",
but it's a thesis I totally agree with. 

Lunch
-----

Usually lunch doesn't get it's own section, but lunch at WTD was *bomb*. There
was Caesar salad. Fresh veggies + fruit. And pasta with tomatoes, spinach, and
hazelnuts. **So good**.

Lightning Talks
---------------

Dialog Trees
~~~~~~~~~~~~
A talk on tool for making effective dialog trees for video games, specifically
Yarn.  Something I know nothing about, and very well done!

Lektor
~~~~~~
Static-site CMS? It's a thing. SSG with dynamic admin site. It seems pretty
cool. Possible fodder for travel blog.  Maybe best talk of the day in terms of
content.

Cats: The perfect pets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

False.

Pantheon
~~~~~~~~
I'm not even sure what this talk was about.  It happened.

Copy That: Helping Users Succeed with Copy
------------------------------------------

**Sarah Day**

Documentation for people who don't read documentation!  Product copy is the
words you use in the product to guide users, like the label on a button, the
title of a page, etc.  It's definitely one of those things that I don't think
about as often as I should, and was wonderfully specific and detailed.  Sarah
pulled up a page from `GoodReads`_ and talked about the use and misuse of copy
on that page. There were diagrams, circles, and it was a very well-practiced
and tight talk.

Readable README
---------------

**Daniel Beck**

More Zen
--------

**Tana Franko**

A gentle reminder of a few often-heard principles that are easy to forget.
Reframe how you think of problems. Simplify your work. Don't forget to have
hobbies.  This was a very successful and loosey-goosey 15 minute talk.

Embed the Docs
--------------

**Kristof Von Tomme**

Another 15 minute "Thunderstorm", this time on how important copy is.  Less
well done than the previous copy talk, but no less important a message.

Writing So Your Words Are Read
------------------------------

**Tracy Osborn**

Long and kind of interesting story?  Not to disrespect Tracy, but stripping out
the self-congratulation at the beginning and giving context in a slide or two
would be much better. Her point of "Know your audience, they aren't necessarily
*you*" is a good one, but again not worthy of a full half hour.  She also makes
a lot of assumptions about how technical people write, which are completely
false in my experience.  I'm definitely not the right audience for this talk,
and as such didn't get much out of it.

Panel: Transforming Your Doc Process
------------------------------------

The panel was probably fine? I don't know, I was really tired + over caffeinated
and in desperate need of food.

Day 2
#####

What Writing Fiction Teaches You About Writing Documentation
------------------------------------------------------------

**Thursday Bram**

Thursday takes principles that everyone (even me -- really, *everyone*) has
heard when writing fiction and talks about how you can apply it to writing
documentation. It was more effective (for me personally) as a review of writing
principles, but was a very entertaining and example-filled presentation none
the less.

7 Values of Effective Tech Writing Teams
----------------------------------------

**Joao Fernandes**

Thesis: Help build products that need no documentation. In-app help, buttons |
labels | tooltips, clear copy, etc. A few of the same ideas  we've heard
repeated at the conference: be brief, be concise, work with your team, know
your audience & product & market, etc. But, if I had to choose *one* of the
talks that covered these topics, it would be this one. The slides were
*gorgeous*, and the speaker was relatively charismatic if a bit monotone.  He
also did an interesting thing where he would introduce an practice, then
explain what would happen if you didn't adopt that practice, which seemed more
effective & interesting than just saying to do the thing.

Building Documentation Culture in Startups
------------------------------------------

**Ruthie BenDor**

Talk of the day!  Ruthie is an engineer with a range of experiences, and this
was basically story time of good and bad experiences with docs.  She's a great
storyteller, really interesting tales with good morals & takeaways, and very
funny.  She also covered a 4-step guide to creating great internal docs that's
general and applicable to any org. Super talk!

Following the Technical Doc Road
--------------------------------

**Christy Lutz**

Very cute Wizard of Oz themed inspiration speech. Believe in yourself, work
with your team, etc. Funny + well-executed + entertaining + ideal for 15 minute
talk.

Using CSAT Data
---------------

**Betsy Roseberg**

CSAT == Customer Satisfaction.  This was mostly about the value of having
on-page user feedback + comment forms in your docs, and how to use that
feedback productively. Excellent 15 minute talk.

Just-In-Time Documentation
--------------------------

**Brianne Hillmer**

The thesis: write your documentation when you know what problems your customers
are having, don't try to guess what problems they will have in the future.
This ends up being lots of short articles like "There's a gear button in the
top left that looks little but actually takes you to what you want" that are
only 2-3 paragraphs, but are exactly what people need. Overall very well
executed, and especially able to keep the audience focused while smelling
Burrito lunch!

Lightning Talks
---------------

Organizing Meetups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Definitely valuable if you're looking to start a meet-up, and the speaker seems
like a very sweet if not well-spoken man.

Documentation in Academia
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given by my hilarious co-worker Jack, I'm 100% biased here. But like everything
Jack does I thought it was clever, funny, and educational.

Earning User Trust
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Meh.


Interactive Document Environments
---------------------------------

**Tim Nugent & Paris Buttfield-Addison**

Also a great talk! Interactive Documentation Environments are Code + Notes + 
Docs, and are a very pretty way of rendering and compiling together those
three things into kind of actual docs. 

Accessible Math on the Web
--------------------------

**Tim Arnold**

MathJax + MathML. If you haven't looked into them, you should!

Oops, I Became an Engineer
--------------------------

**Tara Scherner de la Fuente**

@goatuserstories is a funny twitter. Follow your dreams! Consider community 
college! Win + profit.


Main Takeaways
##############

* Consider working for the government. It won't get better by you being angry
  at it, and they actually do some very cool things.
* What's the current state of your internal docs? It's so easy to focus on external
  docs, but your employees need docs too! A good litmus test is how long it takes
  a new hire to get their first PR up.
* Look out for Lektor and Interactive Documentation Environments. The future
  is bright and beautiful
* Remember your basic writing and humaning principles: know your audience; 
  be brief; ask questions; have respect.
