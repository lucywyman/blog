Hello friends! It's been a while since we saw each other. I hope this post
finds you well! It's that time of year again: the leaves have, fallen, the
chill has set in, and the holidays are just over the horizon. I always find
myself reading more in the winter, when it's too cold to leave my apartment and
nothing sounds better than a mug of tea and a book. Whether you're travelling
to visit family, or have some cozy mornings in your future, here's what I can
recommend adding to your reading list.

PS I'm not a professional enough blogger to make commissions or
anything, but I do have a `book-themed gift guide`_ for all the readers
in your life. And we're all readers! Check it out if you're not sure
what to get someone. Ok, on with our regularly scheduled program.

`Too Fat, Too Slutty, Too Loud`_
--------------------------------
*By Anne Helen Petersen*

I expected this book to be yet another ranty read about how oppressed women
are. While I think those books are important and read a lot of them, it's
draining to read about the systemic problems and rarely be presented with
solutions. "Too Fat, Too Slutty, Too Loud" absolutely blew me away though.
Petersen's writing is precise, intelligent, and clear, and I found myself
having 'Aha!' moments at least once per chapter. A great read for any feminist
(aka everyone).

`How Music Got Free`_
---------------------
*By Stephen Witt*

Another book I expected to be dull, but which turned out to be great! Rather
than laying out the facts in chronological order, "How Music Got Free" wove
together the stories from 3 people who contributed to the rise and fall of
the pirated music industry. It's an epic story, told more like a novel than a
non-fiction account. Thoroughly entertaining and interesting, whether you
like (and pirate) music or not.

`Tiny Beautiful Things`_
------------------------
*By Cheryl Strayed*

I love everything Cheryl Strayed writes. If she wrote a phone book, I'd
probably read it. Her work is consistently thought provoking, concise,
beautiful, and profound, and "Tiny Beautiful Things" is quintessential Cheryl.
A compilation of advice columns, "Tiny Beautiful Things" is all about
understanding the human experience. Part poetry, part therapy, entirely worth
reading.

`Commonwealth`_
---------------
*By Ann Patchett*

This book may not be for everyone, but as a reader who loves a good cast of
characters "Commonwealth" was right up my alley. The characters were rich and
realistic, and the plot follows the story of a blended family we know all to
well with an unexpected twist. An excellent low-stress read.

`Big Little Lies`_
------------------
*By Liane Moriarty*

I know you already know this one, so let me just throw my recommendation in with all the rest.

`Turtles All the Way Down`_
---------------------------
*By John Green*

Even if you're not a young adult, John Green's latest novel is a wonderful
and quick read. It's narrated by the protagonist, Aza Holmes, a young woman
trying to live with and manage obsessive-compulsive disorder while trying to
be a good daughter, good friend, and a good detective. What I loved about it
was that it helped me understand at least one person's experience of mental
illness, and helped humanize and sympathize disordered thinking for me.
