Over the last few weeks I've been assessing my wardrobe, pruning
things that I don't need or wear and deciding what's missing or needs
an upgrade.  After researching `capsule wardrobes`_ for hours and
filling out `Caroline Rector's Capsule Planner`_, I found
a color palette that most of my closet fit into and a few essentials
that I was in need of:

* 2 pairs of jeans. At the time I had 3, which just wasn't enough now
  that I wear them most days.
* Sweaters. I only have 1 (!) sweater, and since I get cold so easily
  I knew I needed more (how did I even survive last winter???)
* A light raincoat. I have a heavy-duty trench perfect for those
  really bad days, but am lacking a light water-proof coat for those
  mild-but-wet days.
* A flannel. I've never considered myself a flannel person, but
  thought it was worth trying this season.
* Flats!  I've always just bought cheap plastic flats from Payless,
  getting new ones every 3-9 months, and decided it was time to stop
  that nonsense.

So! Shopping list in hand, mom and I headed to the Woodburn Outlet
mall for some serious shopping.  4 hours and infinite dressing rooms
later, we emerged elated and victorious!  Here's what I got:

* 2 pairs of `Susie Casual Flats`_, one in black and one in red ($12 each)
* `The Matilda Flat`_ in black ($48) and cognac ($12)
* `Levi's High Rise Skinny Jeans`_ ($40)
* `Crew Sweater`_ from American Eagle in Burgundy($40)
* Flannel from American Eagle in Navy ($35) (not available online)
* `Madewell 10" High Rise Skinny Jeans`_ ($40 on super sale in store!)

Coming in at just under $250, this may have been one of my most
successful shopping trips EVER!  Shopping intentionally, with a
cohesive and functional wardrobe in mind was much more gratifying and
useful than just buying things I liked, or thought other people looked
good in.  In the past I would never have dreamed of a $250 shopping
spree, but now I can pay with confidence knowing I'm buying
(relatively) high quality items that I'll wear again and again, and
that serve my life in ways I need.  I'm still a long way from the
minimal wardrobe I dream of, and I know that some of these purchases
may no doubt turn out to be mistakes. But I'll learn from those, and
continue to create a wardrobe that fits me and my life. 

What's more,
investing in my closet and clothes that fit *now* was very empowering,
with respect to my body.  Like many American women I've struggled to
have a good relationship with my body ever since puberty.  I've never
had an eating disorder, or done anything extreme, but there are always
days that my confidence is just gone, and I find myself obsessing over
how much better I would look if I was skinnier.  I know, logically,
that this is silly: I'm perfectly healthy, and at a perfectly normal
weight and size.  I should also emphasize that, aside from one
horrible boyfriend who called me 'fat' a few times, this pressure was
always internal.  Many people in my life tell me regularly that I'm
beautiful and sexy, and I don't doubt that they mean it. But *I*
didn't feel beautiful, and that's what counts.  Investing in my
wardrobe is one small step towards loving my body **every damn day**,
and not letting the episodes of self-conciousness get to me.  I fit in
these clothes now, and I sure as heck don't want to buy new ones!
What's more, I don't want to buy clothes thinking "I'll look so good
in these once I've lost 10 pounds".  And I didn't. And I will never,
ever do so again. If I do lose weight, then fine, I'll get new clothes
that fit.  But I'm not expecting that, or even hoping for it.  I love
my body now, and want to treat it right by putting things that feel
good on it instead of clothes that squeeze, pull, or pinch it.

Now that my wardrobe is set, I hope to not shop for myself until early
December, when I'll get what I need for winter. Until then, I've got
what I need!
