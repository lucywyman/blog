I've always had a sweet tooth. Chocolate, cake, cookies, pastries, fruit.
Dessert has always been my favorite meal, and sugar is my love language. I
don't tend to eat a lot of sweets because it turns out they aren't very good
for you in frequent and high doses, but when I do it can be a transcendental
experience. There are a handful of desserts, some with memories attached,
that I have dreams about. The kind of desserts that stay with you. I remember
going to New Seasons with my mom late at night to share a slice of their
`Bavarian Banana Cream`_ cake
