Like so many other (mostly white) Americans I spent June making my way through an

[reading
list](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/09/872788889/the-limitations-of-an-anti-racist-reading-list) in
order to feel like I was doing something without actually doing anything. We donated and went to a
few protests as well, but I can't say I feel like I did my due diligence fighting racism this
summer.

I *can* say that Ijeoma Oluo's *So You Want to Talk About Race* was my favorite of the anti-racism
books I read though. I

In a word: *long*. And strangely hollow. I recently heard a painter wax poetic about how eyes can
bring a painting to life or condemn it to a life of mediocre flatness. This book felt like a
painting with flat eyes. It avoided so much of the nitty-gritty political work Hillary has done and
focused on her friendships, romances, and work relationships, in a way that felt utterly un-Hillary.
The Hillary I know is all about the details, the specifics, the policies and plans, but this Hillary
was so focused on feelings and what people thought of her. I also felt like the triumphant tone the
book was supposed to strike was tempered by her lack of a life partner, not because being alone is
sad but because she seemed sad. Given the choice, I'm not sure she would choose being President over
Chelsea and her grandchildren. I guess only she'll ever know.

I will say, the sex scenes were much less provocative and uncomfortable than others make them out to
be. Maybe my tolerance is high because I read so much romance, but c'mon people: everyone fucks.
