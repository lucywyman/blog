Interviewing is a lot like dating.  You put on your nice clothes. You're 
kind of nervous at first. "Will they like me?", "Am I smiling too much?",
"Was I supposed to tell the story about the frog?", "Oh god, I feel something
between my teeth, oh my god, OH MY GOD, CODE BLUE CODE BLUE FOOD IN TEETH
FOOD IN TEETH WHAT DO WE DO".

Needless to say, it's difficult to stand in judgement of other humans, 
particularly with your career on the line!
So, in an effort to remember and transfer the memories of interviewing, I'm
recording my experiences with a variety of organizations here for posterity
(read: Future Lucy).

**NOTE**: I won't be discussing
any details of questions asked during the interviews, and 
will omit the names of anyone who interviewed me.

The Process
-----------

So, as I recently learned, the interview process for 
most tech organizations has three parts. 

0. The application. This is like the profile part of 
   online dating. You submit your resume, the shiniest
   version of yourself in the form of paper, but you lie about 
   knowing Rust instead of liking beer.

1. The HR person. This is usually a 10-15 minute call
   with a really nice person
   where they ask things like "What are you interested in?",
   "When do you graduate?", "Are you willing to relocate?", etc.
   They're just trying to ascertain if you're a good fit for the 
   position you're interviewing for. This is the initial chat
   of online dating, but less awkward.

2. The technical interview.  This is 1 or 2 phone calls
   with an engineer where they ask you to solve a problem or 
   two in a shared document. The problems are almost always 
   related to algorithms, data structures, or networking.
   Seriously, know your networks man.  This is the first/second 
   date stage of the interview, where you try to decide if
   this is even someone you want to get involved with and if 
   there's any possibility for romance.

3. The on site. If your technical interviews go well and 
   you seem like a good fit, you'll have an on site interview.
   This is like 1-2 years of dating in 5 hours.  This is where the company 
   flies you down to their
   location and interviews you for 5-6 hours in 45-60 minute 
   chunks, usually with 1-2 engineers per interview.  Yes, they
   are exhausting, no matter how many times people ask if you
   need water or coffee. It also gives you an appreciation for 
   how arduous transporting humans from point A to point B is.
   This is their (and your) last chance to see if you're ready 
   to commit.  

After the onsite, you're just waiting to hear back. Usually it takes between
a week and a month, but if you haven't heard anything in 1.5 to 2 weeks it's 
appropriate to contact the recruiter you've been talking to and ask when 
you should expect to know.  

The Companies

Apple
~~~~~

I interviewed with Apple on a Monday in early January.  You know 
those industrial parks you go to when your Comcast shit isn't working, 
where they have miles of rectangular concrete buildings where souls go to die?
That's what Apple HQ looks like.  I know, I know, they're building a new
campus that's going to be the bestest tech campus in The World and Mars, but
for now it's pretty subpar.  There's nothing to see or do in Cupertino, so 
when I got there an hour early I ended up just going to Safeway and getting 
mouth wash.  After checking in and hanging out for a while, the marathon began.

I ended up having 6 45-minute interviews with a lunch break after Round 2. 
Each interview was with two engineers from the team I was applying to be on, 
and overall I thought I showed as well as I could have.  There were some 
engineers I instantly clicked with and really liked, and others that were
much less inviting, but on the whole I


Google
~~~~~~

Google had a *beautiful* campus. I got there ~2 hours early, and spent the whole
time exploring.
