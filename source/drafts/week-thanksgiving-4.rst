This is the fourth post of my `Thanksgiving Week`_ series. If you
haven't already, I'd recommend reading the `introduction post`_ first!

I've spent far, far too much of my life thinking about my body.  Is it
thin enough, pretty enough, good enough? As if that's any reflection
of me as a person. But for all of that obsession I rarely took time
to appreciate all of the things my body is capable of, and how
*valuable* my health is. It requires a *lot* of maintenance (was 8
hours of sleep really necessary, evolution?), but having a healthy
body lets me focus on living and experiencing and enjoying.  I can
spend hours hiking, eat most foods, and take care of myself entirely
on my own.  All of which I take entirely for granted, until I get a
headache and then **life stops** until it gets better.
