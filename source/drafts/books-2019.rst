One of my goals for 2019 was to read 100 books (34 more than last year), which successfully spurred
me to consume books at a much faster clip but had some curious side-effects. I don't plan to keep it
up next year, but there are some interesting insights I've gained from high-volume (ha) reading.

The first thing I noticed is that most books are meh. It's hard to know if I just got unlucky, or if
I was less selective, or if my standards are higher, or if there are simply a lot of just-ok books
out there. Whatever the reason, I stopped midway through a higher ratio of books this year and found
many of the books I read unremarkable. They weren't even bad, just meh. Partially this is caused by
reading so much - books have to "work harder" to even be remembered a month later, and I don't take
as much time thinking about each book and reflecting on it. I think most books benefit from careful,
considerate reading, and at 1 book every 3-4 days I just didn't have the capacity for thoughtful
literature consumption necessary to appreciate each title. With that said, even if I had taken my
time with these books, most of them were nothing special.

Maybe that's a good thing though. It's at least partially a reflection of the books I choose to
read: mostly
