I've had a lot of fun writing bucket lists for each season this year
(`summer`_, `fall`_), and for Winter I need some things to look forward to
more than ever. 

☐  Walk down `Peacock Lane`_
☑  Watch the tree light up at Pioneer Square
☐  Decorate a tree
☐  Volunteer
☐  Bake some `cookies`_
☐  Visit Santa
☐  Write Christmas cards for friends and family
☐  Watch Elf
☐  Enjoy some hot chocolate (maybe some `drinking chocolate`_?)
☐  Enjoy a coffee from a local shop
☐  Go to a Christmas Bazaar
☐  Wear a bold lip color at least once
