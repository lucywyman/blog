As you've undoubtedly noticed, many products come in both a women's
and men's versions (ie. deodorant, socks, haricuts, etc.). IMHO this
isn't sexist so much as acknowledgment that men and women are
physically different creatures, BUT, sometimes the men-version of a
thing is much better (for one reason or another) than the
lady-version, even if you identify as a lady.  

Here are a few things I like to buy the non-lady versions of, and
why:

#. **Flannels**. They're often cheaper and always thicker, and while
   the cut is slightly less flattering the men's cut definitely looks
   great.  It'll actually keep you warm. Mine are from `St. John's
   Bay`_ (I promise they came in cuter colors when I bought them!)
#. **Underwear**. I have a medium-to-large sized + very round butt,
   and underwear *always* rides up and I have to fidget and pull it
   down all day long. Even ladies boyshorts do this, since they
   still barely cover my actual butt.  Instead, I've been wearing
   `MeUndies Men's trunks`_ for about a year now, and am never
   looking back.  They last longer, don't squeeze my hips, provide
   full coverage, and look really cute + sexy!  Well worth the
   investment.
#. **Hair Cuts**.  Considering the head of hair I have, I definitely
   need to ask a barber first before having them cut my hair.  That
   said, the best hair cut I ever got was from `University Cuts
   Barber Shop`_ for ~$15. With curly hair, even fancy salon hair
   cuts are very hit-or-miss, and there's nothing worse than
   dropping $60 (or more) and having triangle hair.  Even dressers
   certified by `Deva Curl`_ have not been up to the task!  Whether
   due to bravery, styling skills, or sheer luck, I've had better
   luck at barber shops.
