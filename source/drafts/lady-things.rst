As you've undoubtedly noticed, many products come in both a women's and men's 
versions. Examples: deodorant, flannel shirts, underwear, etc. IMHO this isn't
sexist so much as acknowledgment that men and women are physically different
creatures, BUT, sometimes the men-version of a thing is much better (for
one reason or another) than the lady-version, even if you identify as a 
lady.  

Here are a few things I like to buy the non-lady versions of, and why:

#. **Flannels**. They're often cheaper and always thicker, and while the 
   cut is slightly less flattering the mens cut definitely looks great. 
   It'll actually keep you warm.
#. **Underwear**. I have a medium-to-large sized + very round butt, and 
   underwear *always* rides up and I have to fidget and pull it down all day 
   long. Even ladies boyshorts do this, since they still barely cover my actual
   butt.  But men's boxer-briefs are perfect -- they're basically comfy cotton
   bike shorts, and they generally don't show through my pants (although
   I admittedly wear a lot of skirts + dresses). I should also say they're not
   super pad | panty liner friendly, but honestly neither is women's underwear.
   My advice: get an IUD and be done with the whole period business.
