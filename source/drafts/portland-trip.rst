This last weekend Eli and I went to Portland to celebrate his 21st
birthday and see `Hippocampus`_ at `Mississippi Studios`_.  
`Eric`_, Eli's stepdad drove us from Corvallis to Portland Friday afternoon
at great expense of his time. After ~3 hours in the car we went straight
to the `Baghdad Theater`_ on Hawthorne to grab dinner and see 
the new `Jungle Book`_. It was a solidly C+ movie: visually beautiful, 
conceptually just like the original, as an adult not especially satisfying.
But also a good time with good people, and excellent food (hunger is 
the best sauce).  After that we went back to the house to have cake + presents,
and DRINK BEER (like one beer each). Because Eli and I are actually 80 year olds 
we went to our fancy-schmancy HOTEL at ~10 and immediately fell asleep.  Typical friday night.

Saturday we woke up late, found breakfast at a non-descript chain (don't judge us, 
food in Portland is mad expensive), then wandered over to `Powell's`_. I bought 
a huge bag of cashews and two donuts at Whole Foods which was hands-down the
best purchase I made in all of April, Eli tooled around the book store and
bought a book of `Dilbert`_ comics, then we decided to go to `Ground Kontrol`_. 
After $10 of pinball and one totally bullshit round of Tetris, we ran out of 
cash money so headed out. With nothing else to do, we decided to take 
an urban hike to Eli's parents house, hoping we would arrive around 5pm
when we had agreed to meet them.  This ended up being about 8 miles, which 
sounds like a lot but really wasn't that bad. It was also a *beautiful* day,
and we got to see some cool parts of Portland we don't typically frequent 
such as the Tillikum pedestrian bridge and Waterfront.  It also timed out 
well, as we got to the house around 16:30 and got to eat + hang out for 
a bit before heading out.  

Eli's mom and stepdad are both artists who work from home, and as such are
*really cool* and get to rub elbows with a lot of *really cool* people. 
Like, it's actually a little intimidatingly cool.  They have a friend 
who recently travelled to Paris + Tokyo and spent a few months meeting 
little-known artists in those areas through word-of-mouth.  He then 
compiled his experiences and interviews with these artists into `a book`_
and sold it. For money. *That's how cool these people are*.
