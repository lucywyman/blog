To me, cheating on crosswords has a pretty clear definition: looking up any
information that might help you answer a clue. That *includes* looking up a
fact, even if it isn't directly the answer. It *does not include* asking a
friend for help - I love any puzzle that encourages human connection and
collaboration.
