Happy first day of fall! I have to admit, I'm much more sad to see summer go
this year than I usually am. While I don't usually miss school, September
definitely has a nostalgia to it and I just want more of the warm, sunny,
care-free summer days. But, fall also gives us a lot to look forward to! I've
been loving the crisp mornings, the abundance of apples and pears at the
farmer's market, bringing my sweaters back into rotation, and planning my
Halloween costume. And also the books! While I wait for `What Happened`_ to
come in to the library (hold #124, woo!), here's what I've been reading (and
baking!) lately:

`Over Easy`_
------------

`How Music Got Free`_
---------------------

`Tiny Beautiful Things`_
------------------------

`Ender's Game`_
---------------

`10% Happier`_
--------------
