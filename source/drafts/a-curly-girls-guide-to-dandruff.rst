It's embarrassing, it's itchy, it's *everywhere*. I've had dandruff
since I was a teenager, and as my personal care routine has evolved to
suit my body's needs my dandruff has stubbornly persisted.  When I was
shampooing every day? Dandruff. When I went weeks without shampooing?
Dandruff.  Tea tree oil? Dandruff. Special shampoos? Dandruff. I want
to get to the root (ha) of this problem, and **solve my itchy, flaky
scalp without destroying my precious curls**. Many women, myself
included, will tell you they've spent years perfecting their hair care
routine. It's a science, a long series of experiments and tweaks to
help our hair be healthy and strong.  I don't want to lose all the
progress I've made in that routine, so the challenge here is really to
**fix the dandruff without sacrificing the health of my hair**.
Challenge: Accepted.

I started researching the causes of dandruff and, it turns out,
there are not 1, not 2, but 4 potential causes of dandruff (`Mayo
clinic <http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dandruff/symptoms-causes/dxc-20215281>`_. This means
that you'll have to experiment with different treatments to find what
works for you!  Ok, so let's take a look at those causes:


Fungus
------

EW! According to the Mayo Clinic, one cause of dandruff is "A
yeast-like fungus, Malassezia, which lives on the scalps of most
adults. But, for some, it irritates the scalp and can cause more skin
cells to grow. The extra skin cells die and fall off, making them
appear white and flaky in your hair or on your clothes. Why malassezia
irritates some scalps isn't known." Ok, so we all have some fungus on
our heads. 

Treatments
~~~~~~~~~~

There are a lot of natural treatments for this type of dandruff,
including:

* **Tea tree oil**. My SO uses `this highly concentrated kind`_, rubbing
  it into his scalp after a shower about once a month.
* **Apple Cider Vinegar**. It makes your skin glow! It helps
  digestion! It cures cancer! I know, I know, ACV is practically 
  the coconut oil of 2016. But
  allegedly the acidity helps kill the fungus, and prevent it from
  growing so quickly. **Lemon juice** also works for this.  Mix with
  equal parts water and spray onto scalp ~15-20 minutes before
  showering.
* **Medicated Shampoos**.  You've seen them at the drug store. You're
  looking for one that contains ketoconazole, selenium sulfide, or
  pyrithione zinc. It's recommended you use it as often as your hair
  can handle, which for me is honestly only once a week (even then,
  the next day is rough).  If it
  helps, awesome! If not, read on.

Bacteria
--------

According to 2016 study published in Nature, bacteria (mainly
Propionibacterium and Staphylococcus) can contribute more to dandruff
than Malassezia (`Study`_).

Dry Scalp
---------

Symptoms here are small, less-oily white flakes with no redness or
inflammation. It's especially likely that this if your culprit if you're prone to dry skin on
other parts of you as well.  

Irritated, Oily Skin
--------------------

AKA seborrheic dermatitis.  According to Mayo Clinic, this is the most
common cause of dandruff, though I'm skeptical of this. The symptoms
include red, irritated, greasy skin covered by flaky white or yellow
scales, and is often found on other hairy parts of the body, not just
your scalp (think: eyebrows).  In other words, you would *know* if you
had this, and would definitely want to do something about it. Hence,
skepticism. But if you take a close look at your scalp in the mirror
and do notice redness or greasiness, 

Treatments
~~~~~~~~~~

This is worth seeing your doctor for, and following what they
prescribe.

Buildup
-------

This is just when you don't shampoo enough, so dead skin cells and
oils build up then flake off. Honestly, when I
was only shampooing once a month, I didn't notice my dandruff get
better or worse. I'm guessing, if you're reading this, that this isn't
your issue. But it is a common cause of dandruff for the
less-than-tidy among us, and knowledge worth having in your back
pocket for all those times friends ask you for advice on getting rid
of dandruff.

Treatments
~~~~~~~~~~

* Literally just shampoo more. Any shampoo. 

Bad Reaction to Products
------------------------

I suspect this is kind of rare, and once again that you would know if
you had this, but many hair products contain harsh chemicals that your
skin may be reacting to. If you think this might be the case, or
haven't used a new shampoo in a while, I especially like `Dr. Bonner`_
products for natural soaps and shampoos.  

General Treatments
------------------

There are a few things you can do to keep your body healthy, and
prevent some dandruff in the process. These are all things you already
know you should be doing, but if dandruff is really the kick in the
pants you need to change some habits then do it!

* **Get enough sleep**
* **Drink enough water**
* **Eat a balanced diet**, including lots of **fruits and vegetables**.
* **Exercise**
