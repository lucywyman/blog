Let's start off on a promising note: I'm not actually going to answer
this question here, but only because I don't think it's a question
that can be answered in a blog post(1). If it can even be answered at
all. But, as a professional n00b, it's a question that's been central
to my life for the past few months, and which guides a number of my
actions. The purpose of this post is partially selfish -- I want to
consolidate and give voice to my thoughts on the subject, in hopes of
achieving more clarity. 

In my previous life as a CS student, I thought being good at being an
engineer meant that you: 
1. Have a lot of knowledge. You write your own 
   programming language in your free time, and can explain what a monad
   is, and know intimate details about the Linux kernel.
2. Come up with clever programming solutions. There is a problem!
   There is an obvious but inefficient way to solve it, and then there
   is your clever and efficient solution.

It didn't take long to find out that this notion of a good engineer is
very 1-dimensional and incomplete. But I'm still not sure I know what
it means to be a good engineer. What's the difference between a senior
engineer and a junior engineer? 

[1] And any blog post that does claim to answer it should not be
trusted. Unless it's by `Jeff Atwood`_, then you should probably read
it.
