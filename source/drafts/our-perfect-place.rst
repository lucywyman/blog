I've been listening to `Meet the Frugalwoods`_ this week, and am as
always inspired by Mrs. Thames' writing. 

This led me to thinking about where I'd like to settle ~sometime in
the future~, and I think that like with partners there are lots of
places I could be happy. I don't think that there's *a perfect place*
out there waiting for me to find it, but a spectrum of places where I
would be pretty content. 

* Temperate (30°F - 100°F at extremes, occasional snow)
* Politically liberal
* 30 minutes or less commute
*
