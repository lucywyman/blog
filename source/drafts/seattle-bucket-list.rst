It's no secret that `I`_ `love`_ `making`_ `bucket`_ `lists`_. I
wouldn't call myself a 'spontaneous' person, so like to have a list of
answers when someone says "What should we do today?". It also
encourages me to get out and do stuff, rather than answer the question
with "Sit around and read". The bucket lists are usually seasonal, but
while I was compiling a list of `my favorite places in Seattle`_, I
realized there were so many more places I *wanted* to visit than I had
already visited. We've only been here for a few months, and while it's
impossible to know how life will unfold I don't think we see ourselves
living out our lives here. So why not have a list of things to do
while we're in town, however temporarily? Here's what I hope to do in
the weeks / months / years we live in Seattle:
