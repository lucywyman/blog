I wanted to get 'The Suzy', a latte with raw honey, Ceylon cinnamon milk, and sprinkled with Himalayan pink salt. They don't make decaf espresso though, so I just had a sad decaf pourover that was wayyyyy too expensive.


**Value**: ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆

$5 for my pourover - I don't typically get pourovers so I'm not sure how this price point
compares, but for a perfectly average cup of coffee it felt like way too much.


**Atmosphere**:

Despite so many things going wrong, Push x Pull does have a nice atmosphere. It's a
large and open cafe that's quiet, and has seating for groups and individuals. The vibe is  


**Menu options**: ★ ★ ☆ ☆ 

No decaf espresso, so they had to make a decaf pourover and add milk to it. They
have three special drinks which all sound delicious, but alas I didn't get to enjoy.
Worth noting there's no food, besides 2-3 pastries on a small platter by the register.

I ordered their seasonal maple turmeric latte - while I don't generally buy into the
'healthiness' of turmeric I'm a sucker for a limited-time beverage. This one was spicy and very
sweet, and tasted more cinnamon-y and pepper-y than like turmeric, which I think is a good thing.


**Value**: ★ ★ ★ ☆

My fancy latte was $5.25 + tip, which is about what I would expect but on the pricier side of
coffees.
