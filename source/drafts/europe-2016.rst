Hello, dear reader!  This summer, I had the incredible opportunity to
visit EUROPE for the first time.  I've tried and failed to write a
blog post detailing my experiences there for about a month now, but
keep finding it difficult to put my thoughts into words.  However, one
thing I know how to write is lists, and I know before I started my
journey I spent *hours* researching what to bring and what to leave.
So! Let me throw my hat into the travel-blog-packing-list ring and
tell you what's what on suitcase front.

What I Brought
--------------

Clothes
~~~~~~~
* 


What I Wish I Had Brought
-------------------------
* 2 more dresses
* Zit cream

Conclusion
----------

You'll notice things like a scarf, camera, hair dryer, etc. are absent
from either of these lists. This highlights a critical point:
**Everyone has different needs to help them feel good + prepared**. I
don't do my hair, or wear scarves, or whatever else, but it was
definitely critical for me to have some dresses I felt great in.
Maybe you only need a handful of outfits and one pair of shoes, but
really need a few pairs of earrings to brighten your day there.
Whatever your needs are, think about the things you use **every damn
day**
