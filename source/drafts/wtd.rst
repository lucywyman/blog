Another year of `Write the Docs`_!  Although I don't write as much
documentation as I should, writing is such a key part of day-to-day 
human interaction, and WTD is always a good reminder of basic principles
and encouragement to write more (docs).  It's also an incredibly well run
conference, done through trial and error. Every year they try new things, and
keep the things that work.  It's also one-track, which has pros and cons.

**Pros**: 
* Everyone has the same experience, and it's easy to discuss
* You don't need to make any decisions or miss great talks

**Cons**:
* You have to sit through some sub-optimal talks
* 

WTD is also held at the `Crystal Ballroom`_ in Portland, which is a great
venue.  It's friendly. It's not coprate-y. Good vibes all around. There
were also talks. I wrote about them.

**Side Note:** There were many well-dressed humans, who had very well designed
clothes | bags | accessories. It was wonderful to get out of the university fashion
bubble.

Open Source Docs in Federal Gov't
---------------------------------

**Britta Gustafson**

Contributing to `government software`_ was a thought that had never crossed my mind,
and it turns out that not *all* the governments software is horrible and outdated.
In fact, they have a lot of really cool and interesting APIs, and are incredibly
immersed in Open Source.  Britta recently became a federal employee, working for
the `General Services Agency (GSA)`_ on the `18F`_, and she gave a compelling talk
on why contributing to the government helps you help others.  We often think of 
the government as a crufty old gross thing that takes our money and makes bad 
decisions. But if we want that to change, we *have the power*, especially as 
software developers. Being part of that ecosystem can help strengthen a 
weak and imperfect system, and do good for a lot of people. All good 
things to think about, and really a core part of open source. Great talk, 
great speaker, great topic. 

Customer Support + Docs
-----------------------

**Neal Kaplan**

This was a rough talk. It can really be summed up in one sentence: 
If you write docs, you should talk to your customers and customer support
team more to get a feel for what customers need and what your docs are 
missing.  A good point, but not a half-hour long point. 

Documenting APIs
----------------

**Allison Reinheimer Moore**

Collaboration Between Open Source + Corporate Software
------------------------------------------------------

**Shaun McCance**

Shaun's talk was primarily a call to action for professional
technical writers to help the open source projects they use write
good documentation. Often community members are working on open 
source projects just for fun, and most devlopers don't find 
writing docs very fun. Understandably. So, as paid people who
use words, if you're already writing docs for something, why not 
contribute that to open source?  It strengthens both products, 
makes the world better, unicorns poop rainbows, yay.  This was 
another talk that could really have been 5 minutes of 
"Hey, here's a thought you might not have had, do the things!",
but it's a thesis I totally agree with. 

Lunch
-----

Usually lunch doesn't get it's own section, but lunch at WTD was
*bomb*. There was caesar salad. Fresh veggies + fruit. And 
pasta with tomatoes, spinach, and hazelnuts. **So good**.

Lightning Talks
---------------

Dialog Trees
~~~~~~~~~~~~
A talk on tool for making effective dialog trees for video games,
specifically Yarn.  Something I know nothing about, and very well done!

Lektor
~~~~~~
Static-site CMS? It's a thing. SSG with dynamic admin site. It 
seems pretty cool. Possible fodder for travel blog.  Maybe best talk
of the day in terms of content.

Cats: The perfect pets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

False.

Pantheon
~~~~~~~~
I'm not even sure what this talk was about.  It happened.

Copy That: Helping Users Succeed with Copy
------------------------------------------

Documentation for people who don't read documentation! 
Product copy is the words you use in the product to guide 
users, like the label on a button, the title of a page, etc.
It's definitely one of those things that I don't think about
as often as I should, and was wonderfully specific and detailed.
*name* pulled up a page from `GoodReads`_ and talked about the use
and misuse of copy on that page. There were diagrams, circles, and 
it was a very well-practiced and tight talk.
