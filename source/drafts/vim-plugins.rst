I'm ashamed to admit that I've been using `vim`_ for about 4 years now, and have *only just* discovered `vim plugins`_. And they're blowing my mind.

Don't get me wrong: I've always known that vim plugins existed. I just didn't realize there was a rich world of well-written and helpful plugins that can make vim so much better!
