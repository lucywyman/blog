The Definitive Guide to Pumpkin Spice Yogurt

Noosa doesn't disappoint. This yogurt is basically melted ice cream - it's rich and creamy, sweet and tangy. The pumpkin with the perfect balance of squashy and spicy. I was initially skeptical that the small dollop of pumpkin could flavor the entire tub of yogurt, but the people at Noosa are *scientists* and proved me dead wrong. To make it more perfect the lid is reusable, so you can savor your pumpkin Noosa over the course of a few days. Enjoy, and make sure you don't look at the nutrition label.

Chobani

3 stars
Spice: 2 stars
Pumpkin: 3 stars
Yogurt: 4 stars
Experience: 3 stars

This was my second yogurt after having Noosa, and honestly there was never any contest. Chobani's yogurt is thicker, but also somehow less creamy than Noosa. The yogurt was too spicy without having the balance of sweetness or the earthiness of squash. Chobani is the chai protein shake to Noosa's homemade pumpkin milkshake: nominally "healthier", but at what cost?
