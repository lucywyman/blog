Eli and I spent this last weekend at `PAX West`_, and it was an
*incredible* experience. I liken it to Disneyland in many ways:
there's bright lights and beautiful displays, everyone is trying to
sell you something, and *there are so many lines*. While Eli loves
video games, I'm more of a board gamer, so avoided the biggest crowds
and spent most of my 4 days there playing games new and old. This made
me reflect on what games I already play and love, and what kind of
gamer I am. We tend to play fun, light-to-mid weight games that focus
on interactions between players (either cooperative or competitive),
and are suckers for a good party game. The games we play are
accessible to anyone interested in board gaming, and while these games
are easy to learn and play they're difficult to master and are highly
replayable. Here are the games we keep playing again and again:
