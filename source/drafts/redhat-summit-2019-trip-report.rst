This was a *fantastic* conference experience. Many of the people we
talked to were excited about Bolt and had never heard of it before. A
decent subset of those people were using Ansible to run Puppet, which
was part of the original inspiration for Bolt and an ideal use case
where Bolt can replace Ansible. It was so energizing and exciting
to see people interact with Bolt and understand it, and I was
surprised by how much I loved getting to tell people about it and demo
it! I hadn't realized how proud I was of Bolt, or how receptive to it
passers by would be. It was so rewarding to meet people who were using
and loving Bolt, people who lit up when I told them about it, and
people who came back later in the conference with friends to have us
show them Bolt as well!

There were 4 main demos we had, and I'd say 90% of people were
'looking for' or excited about one of those use cases.

* Running commands: For some users, just being able to run ad-hoc
  * commands across infra with Bolt was compelling. This is definitely

Questions
---------

1. How is Bolt better than Ansible if I'm not already using Puppet?
2.
