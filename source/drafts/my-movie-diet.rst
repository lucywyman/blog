You read right: I'm doing a movie diet this summer. No More Bad
Movies. Diets are all about being conscious of the food you're eating,
including:

* How it affects your body
* Where it comes from
* What it's made of
  
As the summer blockbuster season approaches I want to take the same
ideas and apply them to movies. I want to be conscious of where the
movies I watch come from, of what they do to me (and our culture), and
how they're made.  And just like with food, I want to **vote with my
dollars** to support Good Movies. 

Choosing your movie diet is about finding what's important to you and
focusing on spending more time there. The movie diet you choose
shouldn't be hard, or about restriction. It should be about
consciously choosing how you spend your money, and what you support in
the process. It should be about seeing movies you can feel good about,
and not going just be somewhere that's air-conditioned. So much of
what we eat and watch is just because it's there, or it's easy, or
it's convenient. My movie diet is about finding what's good over
what's convenient, and not passively consuming what's available. 

Personally, my movie diet is about being comfortable saying "No" to
movies I don't want to see. Like food, movies have taken on a cultural
significance and become something to do rather than just being what
they are. I often find myself agreeing to see movies I have no
interest in because my brother / mother / boyfriend's parents want to
see it together this Friday, and I don't want to miss out on that
experience with people I love. For me, my movie diet is about finding
other ways to connect with and spend time with the people I love that
don't include Bad Movies (but that can include Good Movies!). Like
with food diets, my movie diet doesn't need to be something I adhere
to strictly 100% of the time. I can still rewatch `Valentine's Day`_
and feel ok about myself. But my movie diet empowers me to say "No" to
doing things I just plain don't want to do. And I hope it can do the
same for you! 

Like with food diets, there are a million and one different ways you
can focus on any of those 3 motivations. Below are some diet-analogous
options so you can choose the movie diet that's right for you!

The Movie Home-cook
-------------------

Even my dad knows that food made at home is usually better for you
than food made in a restaurant. Don't worry, this diet doesn't require
you to make your own movies! It just requires watching most of them at
home.  Movies `make most of their money`_ in theaters, and by waiting
until a movie comes out to a streaming service / DVD you're voting
with your dollar to have less of those movies made. Plus, let's be
honest: you're less likely to be tempted by a bad movie when you have
all the movies on Netflix to choose from than when you go to the
theater and have to choose between `Baywatch`_ and `Bossbaby`_. Like
with eating out, this diet doesn't recommend that you *never* go out
to see a
movie. 

**The Diet**: Only see 1-2 movies in theaters per month. Take time to
plan which movies you'll see, and make a night of it like you would
going out to a fancy meal.

.. _make most of their money:
.. _Baywatch:
.. _Bossbaby:

Movie Vegetarian
----------------

This is gross oversimplification, but I tend to think of vegetarianism
as a moderate form of veganism. Both are often motivated by similar
factors (environmental, dietary, animal rights, etc.), but
vegetarianism can be a way to slowly introduce positive dietary
changes that impact large swaths of the animal-product industry
without needing to give up cheese. Similarly for the Movie Vegetarian,
you can slowly introduce meaningful changes to your film-diet without
needing to turn down 

Movie Vegan
-----------

Movie Whole30
-------------

In my estimation, Whole30 is about avoiding processed and packaged foods (among other things that aren't good for your system!).
