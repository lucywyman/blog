Places
~~~~~~

Rice & Spice
------------

The cutest little asian market in Oregon! If you're looking for rice cakes
filled with red bean paste, shrimp chips, or dried seaweed, Rice and Spice is
your place. It's run by the nicest couple, and is always a fun Saturday night
adventure to get something you've never tried before.

Bald Hill
---------

Just west of the OSU campus, Bald Hill was the perfect place to go for a run, a
hike, a picnic, to watch the sunrise, or just generally to get out of town for
a few hours. With a direct path from campus and a few different easy trails to
hike up, nowhere is more convenient for a quick dose of natural beauty. 

Fred Meyer Loft
---------------

The best kept secret in Corvallis: the Fred Meyer has a second floor.
