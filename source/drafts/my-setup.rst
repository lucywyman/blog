Below is a list of tools I use to make computering easier & more
fun.  Not all of them are the objective best tool for my use case,
but often by this point it's not worth the overhead + loss of
productivity to learn a new *slightly better* tool.  I've categorized
them by perceived likelihood that you, the general reader, will know
about the tool already.

Fehbg
~~~~~

`Feh`_ is an 'image viewer and cataloguer' which I mostly use to
randomly set the background on my machine.  I have a directory of
images I've saved over the years, and per instructions on the arch
wiki ran :code:`feh --randomize --bg-fill ~/.wallpaper/*`.  Each
time I restart my window manager (ctrl+R) I get a new one, which
means I can cycle through a few each morning before finding one that
I like for the day.

Vimperator
~~~~~~~~~~

`Vimperator`_ is a Firefox addon that allows you to use vim
keybindings in firefox. For example, the regex :code:`^[0-9]+dd$`
will close the specified number of tabs starting from the one you
currently have open.  It's also very easy to turn it "on" and "off"
(that is toggle vimperator being disabled), as you just need to hit
the insert key, not go into your FF settings or anything.  Sometimes
it's really handy, especially if you have a really sucky touchpad
like me, but some people find it annoying.
