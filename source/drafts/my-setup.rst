Vimperator
~~~~~~~~~~

`Vimperator`_ is a Firefox addon that allows you to use vim keybindings in
firefox. For example, the regex :code:`^[0-9]+dd$` will close the specified
number of tabs starting from the one you currently have open.  It's also very
easy to turn it "on" and "off" (that is toggle vimperator being disabled), as
you just need to hit the insert key, not go into your FF settings or anything.
Sometimes it's really handy, especially if you have a really sucky touchpad
like me, but some people find it annoying.
