On August 1st I celebrated my first year of full-time work in
Corporate America. It's been an eye-opening year to say the least, and
working a 9-5 desk job for 365 days led to some unexpected
realizations about my country and culture, my industry, and most
importantly myself. All of these realizations are rooted partially in
the expectations that built up over the 15 years I spent in school,
preparing me to enter this very workforce, and partially in my own
particular brand of millennial naivete (and wisdom -- millennials get
an unnecessarily bad rap). This post, like all my posts, is a flailing
attempt to capture those feelings and put them into words.

On School
---------

Let's take it for granted that schools are a broken system which don't
adequately train today's young people for the world they will inherit. Not only
are the subjects irrelevant to everyday adult life, but tests and homework are
cripplingly stressful and ineffective means of learning or proving knowledge.
High school becomes a countdown to college, and then college becomes a
countdown to ~working~. As a student, working seems downright glamorous. "You
mean I can do what I'm doing right now, but someone will *give me money for
it*? And I don't have to take tests, or re-solve problems that have already
been solved, or keep track of the one most important piece of paper I need to
graduate?". And it's true: compared to school, working is *a dream*. But in
dreaming for so many years about working life, it's easy to only think of the
good parts. I didn't realize when I was in school that school gave me a *a
purpose* and *goals* that work doesn't necessarily provide. School provides a
sense of community and camaraderie that, even at a fun-and-friendly start-up
like my office, just doesn't exist in the workplace. 

This is all to say that I think work-vs-school is like curly-vs-straight: the
grass is always greener on the other side. Or, rather than being greener, there
are unexpected pros and cons to both working and being in school. But this is
the mindset I (and many of my fellow doe-eyed peers) entered the workforce
with: School was terrible, surely working will be perfect!

A Working Millennial

Work in America
---------------

**Note**: Since America is the only country I've worked in and I have no points of
comparison to other cultures or countries, this section may be
woefully full of stereotypes. That said, I think the experience of a
desk job in America is a unique one, and I'll try to capture that
here. 

It's often said that in America, we "live to work rather than
work to live", and this is perhaps the truest statement in this post.
Many of my coworkers will be online at all hours of the day, sending
work emails at 6am and putting up new code at 6pm. They'll host work
events from 5pm-8pm, or have a meeting with a visiting executive at a
local bar after dinner. I think this works for 



Working in Tech

Working for Myself
------------------

* **Work is a marathon. And like a marathon, it's hard**. School, and
  particularly university, is a series of sprints: short 10-week
  bursts of intense, 24/7, soul-crushing work followed by a 1-4
  week rest. This wasn't great -- I don't think I went a single
  term at university without breaking down in tears at least
  once, overwhelmed by everything I had to do. While I don't miss the
  sprints, learning to run a marathon has been a difficult adjustment.
  I find myself naturally pushing hard for a few weeks, coming in
  early and staying late to finish one project or another, only to be
  surprised after 3 months of this that there isn't an end in sight
  and I'm burning out fast. I've been working diligently to not run
  myself ragged during the day-in and day-out, and to do things that
  recharge me in my free time. That last bit is something I'm still
  working on, and I think finding creative outlets (like this blog!)
  and a more solid community are 2 things that are lacking my life
  right now. But baby steps. 
* **You don't own your time**. Yes, school is a broken and terrible
  system. Yes, it doesn't relate to real life, and doesn't serve it's
  students as much as it should. But even at school, even when you're
  awake at midnight on a Saturday trying desperately to finish an
  assignment, you own your time. One thing that surprised me about
  work was how much I feel, viscerally, that my time at work is not
  my own. This isn't because I work for a terrible company where I'm
  constantly reminded of this, but it's because when I need to leave
  early in the day for something I need to tell someone, and time-shift
  work to accommodate the absence, or take some PTO. It's because I
  feel little pangs of guilt when I take an hour and a half for lunch, and feel
  obligated to stay a little later because of that. I don't know how
  else to describe it, but I am *definitely* working for The Man, and
  I'm not sure I enjoy it.
* **Office politics are inevitable**. I interned at my current
  workplace before accepting a full-time gig there, and during that
  internship I thought my office was a perfect oasis free of office
  politics and drama. And for the most part it is. But I realize now
  that 3 months of internship is *so short*, and that as an adult
  working full-time I see more of the 
* **It takes effort to make room for other things in your life**. 
* **My work, in part, defines me**. I know that many people are comfortable
  with a job being just a job. For me, personally, I cannot escape the feeling
  that my work is my life, and that if I'm not enjoying it or creating
  something valuable during it than I am wasting it. What impact am I having on
  the world? What am I doing for 2080 hours each year, with 5/7 days each week?
  I really struggle with these questions, and with finding meaning in my work.
  When I first started, I thought that I would just enjoy the job as a learning
  experience. I didn't especially care what I was writing code for, as long as
  I got to learn new things and solve interesting problems. Over the course of
  the last year that's really shifted for me. I can't exactly pinpoint when it
  happened, but I've come to realize that finding meaning in my work is key to
  my success and happiness, and while the company I work for definitely isn't
  evil, and is in fact doing work I think is tremendously good and valuable, I
  can't shake the feeling that I'm not making a difference there. 


**Note**: Folks make a lot of generalizations and assumptions about
millennials that are false, yet become part of our cultural narrative.
I think we pile too many of our fears and discomforts about the future
onto millennials because it's easy and we're afraid of how different
our kin are from ourselves. I know it's impossible to ask this of you,
reader, but if you can leave that millennial baggage right here and
don't bring it with you into the following paragraphs. This is my experience as a
member of my generation, not as the caricature we so often imagine.
