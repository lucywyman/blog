The title of this post is a tad misleading, since it's my favorite books that I
*read* in 2017, not my favorite books that *came out* in 2017. But it's a great
list nonetheless! In fact, I think it's made better by some of the classics,
stand-bys, and re-reads that appear on the list. 

There are 2 types of books that I love. Let's call them 'vegetable books' and
'dessert books'. Vegetable books are a tasty and essential part of a balanced
literary diet, but they do require some discipline to get through. They are
books that inform me, that change how I see the world, and show me new
perspectives and ways of thinking. Books that I grow from. Dessert books, on
the other hand, are scrumptious reads that I devour in 1 day and love reading.
They contain worlds and stories that I deeply connect with, characters that I
fall for and plots that hold my interest. It should be said that not
all dessert books are "good" books, but they are books I love to read
nonetheless. Some books are a bit of both vegetable and dessert (maybe they can
be 'fruit books'?).  Everything on this list is definitely in the dessert
category. This isn't to spurn the vegetable books -- they do a lot for me, and
are very enjoyable reads. But this list is about having fun, and frankly
vegetables just aren't very fun. I'll save the vegetables for other lists of
recommended reads.

2017 has been my `year of waiting`_, and while living alone has it's ups and
downs it does give me lots of time to read (or, I should say, listen!).
