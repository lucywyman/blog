Why I'm Not Sad About Leaving Puppet
------------------------------------

As Puppet gets bigger, there are understandable 'corporate niceties' that we start to follow, for better or worse. While these do provide a nice social script for interacting with people we don't know very well, they also take the humanity out of our interactions at times. 

This was taken over what I consider a big, fat, red line during my last compensation review. I got an 'E' at my last performance review, and the natural next question was "What do I need to do to be an F?". My manager said there was nothing more I could do, that there was simply a limit on the number of Fs assigned throughout the org, and I just didn't quite make the cut into that 'stellar' category. I was disappointed but tried to be understanding. After a few minutes, my manager said:
"There is one thing, and I've really debated whether to tell you or not, but just some personal advice from me. After the election, you hosted a support group for anyone who wanted to talk about what had happened, and sent an email to the whole company. Don't do that. It's not about the politics, but you never know when someone who doesn't agree with you will read that, and that person might be in a position of power. You just don't want to be out of favor with some people at the company."

I actually didn't even send out an email on November 9th,
