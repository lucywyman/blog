One of the `highlights of 2018`_ was moving to Seattle with my
beloved, along with two close friends from college. This year has been
blissful, 

Seattle and Portland
--------------------

I'm often asked how Seattle compares to Portland, and the most true
answer is that I like Seattle more than I thought I would, but miss
Portland more than I thought I would. My experience of the cities is
very much colored by my living situation in each - I'm sure I like
Seattle more because I have only experienced Seattle living with Eli,
and compare it to living alone in Portland.

Along that line, I LOVE living with Eli. Having lived alone for 2
years I was a bit worried that living together might strain our
relationship, as it does so many of our peers. But it's just the
opposite: our house feels more like home with Eli there, and I don't
know how I went 2 years without getting to see him every night and
talk about how our days went and cuddle on the couch. I love getting
to hang out all the time with my best friend, and moving in together
has dramatically increased my happiness.

I also love living with roommates. We're lucky to live in a big house
with enough space for everyone, and I love being able to hang out any
time. 3pm on a Tuesday? Let's make lunch together. Anyone want to have
pizza dinner Thursday night? All those small interaction I usually
have to arrange with other friends ~just happen~, and it gives Seattle a
sense of warmth and belonging.

I Like Seattle

So, all that caveat aside, I've enjoyed Seattle more than I thought I
would. I expected the city to feel too big, the people to be icy, and
the weather to be unbearable. But Seattlites are some of the warmest,
nicest people I've met - I had an entire 5 minute conversation about
kale on my way home from the grocery store with a complete stranger.
The city is definitely bigger[1] in a way that's vibrant and alive
rather than crowded and busy. There are so many great shows, `beautiful
parks`_, `quirky storefronts`_, `murals`_, `events`_, and
neighborhoods to explore, and

What's Next

As of this writing we don't know what's next. Our lease is up June
2019, and at least one of our roommates plans to move to a
neighborhood further north in Seattle.

`725,000`_ compared to Portland's estimated `647,000`_
