One of the `highlights of 2018`_ was moving to Seattle with my
beloved, along with two close friends from college. This year has been
exciting and lonely and fulfilling and new, and I've learned so much
about myself and what makes me happy. 

.. _highlights of 2018:

Seattle and Portland
--------------------

I'm often asked how Seattle compares to Portland, and the most true
answer is that I like Seattle more than I thought I would, but miss
Portland more than I thought I would. My experience of the cities is
very much colored by my living situation in each - I'm sure I like
Seattle more because I have only experienced Seattle living with Eli,
and compare it to living alone in Portland.

Along that line, I LOVE living with Eli. Having lived alone for 2
years I was a bit worried that living together might strain our
relationship, as it does so many of our peers. But it's just the
opposite: our house feels more like home with Eli there, and I don't
know how I went 2 years without getting to see him every night and
talk about how our days went and cuddle on the couch. I love getting
to hang out all the time with my best friend, and moving in together
has dramatically increased my happiness.

I also love living with roommates. We're lucky to live in a big house
with enough space for everyone, and I love being able to hang out any
time. 3pm on a Tuesday? Let's make lunch together. Anyone want to have
pizza dinner Thursday night? All those small interaction I usually
have to arrange with other friends ~just happen~, and it gives Seattle a
sense of warmth and belonging.

I like Seattle
--------------

I've enjoyed Seattle more than I anticipated. I expected the city
to feel too big, the people to be icy, and the weather to be
unbearable. But Seattlites are some of the warmest, nicest people I've
met - I had an entire 5 minute conversation about kale on my way home
from the grocery store with a complete stranger.  The city is
definitely bigger[1] and busier than Portland, much more east-coast
hustle-and-bustle. There are so many great shows, `beautiful parks`_,
`quirky storefronts`_, `murals`_, `events`_, and neighborhoods to
explore. We made an effort this year to go out and experience
our new city more than we did in Portland or Corvallis (thought
there's also a lot of things we missed!), and I loved getting to
experience a lot of those things with our roommates.

I miss Portland
---------------

While I loved getting to live in a new city with new people in a new
house, I was surprised by how much I missed Portland. I missed a lot
of things that happen to be located in Portland: my family, my
friends, my coworkers, Los Gorditos. But I also missed the city
itself in a way that's hard to describe. Portland and Seattle are
similar in a lot of ways: they have similar values, are similar
politically, have similar climates, etc. Seattle never felt like Home
the way Portland does though - honestly, probably just because I
didn't grow up there. I think I could have learned to love Seattle the
way I love Portland. Or maybe there was only room for one city in my
heart all along. Either way, there's a certain je ne sais qua in
Portland. It's cozy and vibrant, my little community-centered,
bikable, liberal haven of a town. There's no expectations or judgment
here - no dress code, vegan food isn't weird, entire streets are bike
paths. I 'reserved' a parking spot for our UHaul on moving day, and
the Portland Bureau of Transportation official *included her pronouns
in her email signature*. It was glorious.

Living in Seattle for a year helped me appreciate the things I had
taken for granted in Portland, and erased any doubt that it's where I
eventually want to settle. 

What I Learned
--------------

1. Working from home is not for me.
2. Living with Eli IS for me.
3. I can make friends anywhere (or at least anywhere in the PNW)
4. Living close to friends makes seeing them easier.

Conclusion
----------

[1] Though Seattle's population is only modestly larger, at about
`725,000`_ compared to Portland's estimated `647,000`_
