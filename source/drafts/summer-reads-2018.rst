If February and March were a drought of good books, then April and May
have seen downpours! I've been reading up a storm based on
recommendations from `book clubs`_, `podcasts`_, and `blogs`_, and
have found myself reading one great book after another! Great might
actually be a bit of a strong word for these books -- maybe fun is
more appropriate? Regardless, these books are ~perfect~ for the
upcoming summer months, with it's beach trips, long drives, airplane
rides, and lazy Sundays.
