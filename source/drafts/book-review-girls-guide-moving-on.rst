Another solid girly-summer-read, this is a mid-level candy read.
The female characters are typically weak and have terrible communication
skills, but are starting to lean the tiniest bit towards being strong.
Everyone is pretty flat as characters go, and the dialogues and 
thoughts of the protagonists leave a lot to be desired. At the same
time, it's not a great literature kind of book.  It totally
lives up to the expectations of what a good palate-cleansing
chick-lit book should be, and was a good break from heavier
books like `When Breath Becomes Air`_
