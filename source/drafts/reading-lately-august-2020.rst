Another light but overwhelmingly successful reading month (and thank God as I'm backdating these

`Leave Only Footprints`_: 5/5

*Leave Only Footprints* follows CBS Sunday Morning correspondent Conor Knighton on his tour of every
National Park in America over the course of a year, and damn I wish I was living that life. It's
not all sunshine and rainbows, as Knighton just got dumped by his fiance, but...I still might be
willing to trade. Knighton's account is casual and modern, like hearing your friend tell you the
long story sprinkled with some musings about topics like politics, technology, and race on the
trails. He covers how the National Parks came to be, interviews rangers and tourists across the
country to understand their relationship to nature, and recounts unexpected adventures along the
way. What I loved most about *Leave Only Footprints* was the playful tone, and of course the

I have to confess...I never read *Crazy Rich Asians* ðŸ™Š. The movie was *gorgeous* and incredible,
but for some reason (maybe the number of holds at the library?) I just never found my way to any of
Kwan's books.

Ok, so as if that wasn't embarrassing enough...I've also never seen *A Room with a View* ðŸ™ˆ. I
promise I didn't grow up locked in a closet! Despite not having consumed the two artworks that *Sex
and Vanity* sits at the intersection of, I *loved* this book. It had all the glamor and vibrancy of
*Crazy Rich Asians* (the movie at least), with
