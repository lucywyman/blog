PBS just released their 100 Great American Reads challenge, along with
a 'quiz' of how many of the books you've read. While reading through
the list I was struck by how with each book I had read I remembered
the events around reading the book more than the content of the book
itself. Much like how the smell of grass clippings and barbecue will
always remind me of my dad, I realized the power of these books was
not just to communicate powerful ideas and tell great stories but to
remind us of who and where we were when we read them. When I think
about "Pride and Prejudice", I don't just recall the feeling of
Elizabeth reading The Letter, or Colin Firth emerging from a pond. I
remember my friend Mackenzie, who's spoken at conferences about Jane
Austen and spent our childhoods reading and obsessing over each of her
books, most of all P&P. I remember sleepovers watching the BBC
version, and reading the book for our senior English class, and making
jokes that so-and-so was "Such a Mary".
