This book wasn't for me - I don't think because it was a bad book, but
because it was *so boring*. I made it halfway through before giving up
for greener pastures (er, books). I found I just didn't care at all
about any of the characters, and was only occasionally enraged at the
injustice of the gender norms. I think writing in third-person is hard
like that - while I appreciated the switching perspective, and stories
from each character, I never felt like I knew any of the characters.
The timeline is difficult to keep track of, and there's just no depth
to anyone in the story. I just couldn't muddle through such a big book
of nothing.
