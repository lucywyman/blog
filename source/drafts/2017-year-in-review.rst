What a year! I know so many people who talk about how quickly time moves, but
for me this year (and most years) feel more like decades. I'm not sure why time
moves so slowly for me (and I'm certainly not sad about it!), but thinking back
to last January it feels like a whole lifetime ago. Was it really only 11
months ago that I was marching Portland's streets on a cold and rainy Sunday? Only 7 months ago I visited Austin? 

Maybe it's because a lot happened this year. Eli graduated! I moved to a new
position at work. We took a road trip to California. But mostly this year has
felt like a lot of waiting. `2016 was a truly life-changing year`_ in so many
ways (some good, some with orange hair), and 2018 will likely be just as
momentous. We're taking a 3 week vacation to JAPAN in January (Japanuary), then
Eli and I are moving to Seattle with 2 good friends and starting our life
together. 2017 has been the in-between year. The middle child of years. The
long-distance-relationship, long-work-hours,
long-time-waiting-for-Eli-to-graduate year. Perhaps that's why it's moved so
slowly?

But, while 2017 may not be as remarkable as the years that surround it, it's
worth reflecting on. Here goes.

What am I most proud of?

What area did I struggle with the most? And what lesson did I learn from that struggle?
What are my 3 happiest memories?
1. Spending the day with my mom at The Grove. Although our early-December trip was already planned, my grandpa died just weeks before we were scheduled to visit. He was 94, lived a good and long life, but it was still a blow to my mom. We had a few days to spend in LA before the funeral, and while we should probably have spent more time helping my grandma move things or visiting other relatives we did what my grandpa would have wanted us to do: eat cake, shop, and gaze in awe at the beautiful people of LA. It was just the perfect day in the sun with my mom, despite all the sadness.
2. Dinner at Fogo de Chao to celebrate Eli's graduation. 
3. 
What did I accomplish?
When was I the most scared? Would I handle that fear the same or different?”
What habit did I form/break that I’ll continue next year?
Who made my heart flutter?
Who did I spend the majority of my time with? Was that energizing or draining?
What new skills, hobbies or activities did I try this year?
What was my most magical moment in nature?
When was I the most fully expressed version of myself? When was I not (and why) ?
When did I do something wonderful for someone?
When did I allow myself to be helped by someone else?
What moment brought me the most joy at work?
How did I take care of my health? And in what ways did I ignore it?
What money was the best spent? And what money was wasted?
What is one thing I created this year?
Is there anything to anyone left unsaid?
Who or what am I the most grateful for?
What surprised me the most?
When did I stand up for what I believe in?
Where have I healed?
What do I know for sure (about myself, about life, about love, etc) ?
