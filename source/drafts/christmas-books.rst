I know, I know. It's too early.  But...is it? I feel like I go through
this every year: it's always too early to start thinking about the
holidays until December 20th, and then I'm scrambling to find or make
good gifts for my family and friends. I don't know about you, but I do
*not* work best under that kind of pressure. I also don't have the
foresight to do what my mom does and just shop for presents
year-round, finding things she thinks people will like. We can't all
be planners.

So, November 2nd seems like a good enough in between. And what better
gift is there to give than a good story?  Whether your
recipient is an enthusiastic reader or hasn't picked up a book in
years, I think there's something for everyone at the local book store.
Here are my recommendations, no matter who you're giving to!

For the Non-Reader
------------------

This is definitely the hardest person to buy a book for. You may have
a better gift idea for them, in which case I say go for it. But with
the rise of audiobooks, coloring books, and graphic novels
I think you can find something for everyone! Let's break it down.

Audiobooks
~~~~~~~~~~

I can't overstate how much I love audiobooks. I spend so much time
walking, running, doing laundry, cooking, stretching, *doing*, and
being able to spend that idle time with a book in my ears has been
life changing. I use `Overdrive`_ (way better than Audible!), which
connects to your local library and lets you download e-books and
audiobooks to any device, including *your phone*. **For free**.
Fancy, right? Here's how you can turn that into a non-reader gift:

* **Set it up**. Installing the app, connecting it to the library,
  downloading books, connecting the phone to the
  car...it can be a lot. Getting everything ready to go so your loved
  one just has to press 'play' could be the push they need to remember
  how much they love books!
* **CDs**. I know I know I know. But again, sometimes setting it all
  up on the phone is just too much.  Give your loved one a book on
  tape they can play in the car. Especially perfect if you've got an
  upcoming road trip!
* **Your own recommendations**. Sharing a book together is a beautiful
  thing. Seeing a novel through someone else's eyes can open up new
  perspectives, interpretations, and meaning you may not have seen.
  And you get to share a thing you love with a person you love.

Coloring Books
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You've seen them.  You've thought "Really? Adult coloring books?".
Your friend's mom has one. And now, your mom can have one too!
Coloring is meditative, methodic, excellent to keep your hands busy
while watching TV.  Here are a few that look neat:

Graphic Novels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not just for kids! Graphic novels have grown into beautifully
illustrated, intricate stories with as much character development,
plot, and interest as any other book.  Here are a few that are really
stunning:

* `Blankets`_ by Craig Thompson. This was definitely the first graphic
  novel I read where I realized what a graphic novel could be.

For the History Buff
--------------------

* `White Trash: The 400-Year Untold History of Class in America`_ by
  Nancy Isenberg.  
* `HRC`_. You may as well start reading up on the life and times of
  our president ;)

For the Girl Boss
-----------------

By far the hardest category to narrow down, it's hard to go wrong with
any of these titles for the feminist reader (woops, sorry, I
misspelled 'everyone') in your life:

* `Shrill`_ by Lindy West
* `The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo`_ by Amy Schumer

For the Mathlete
----------------

These are ordered by difficulty / level of math, from most advanced to
most accessible.

* `GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach`_ is a mind-bending, brain-exploding math +
  philosophy book. This is perfect your friend who just started grad
  school, or your cousin who thinks he's the smartest person on
  planet Earth.
* `Love and Math`_ is just a great math book.  Part memoir, part
  linear algebra, Edward Frenkel 
* `How Not to Be Wrong`_ is for the armchair mathematician. It's a
  critical analysis of how we approach problems, and common data
  analytics methods.  More "How to think about this real-world issue" than
  "Here's how Andrew Wiles solved the Fermat Theorem".  My favorite
  quote is:
  *"And you can't deny that there are aspects of the natural
  world - I'm thinking pandas here - that seem more likely to have
  resulted from grudging bureaucratic compromise than from the mind of
  an all knowing deity with total creative control"*

For the Family Clown (TODO)
--------------------

For the Mystery Lover (TODO)
---------------------
Completely unexpectedly, I've started reading mysteries recently. I
didn't even know what I was getting myself into, but here are a few
juicy ones I've enjoyed.

* `I'm Thinking of Ending Things`_ by 
* `All is Not Forgotten`_ by
* `The Girl on the Train`_ by . Honestly, when I first read it I
  thought it was a little meh. I had a hard time connecting to the
  main character, or caring about what happened to her. But with all
  the hype + the movie, I may have to give it another read.

For the Sci-Fi
--------------

* `Ready Player One`_ by Ernest Cline
* `Use of Weapons`_ by Iain Banks
*
