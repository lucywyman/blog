Just 3 books this month - we were in the thick of looking for a new house, and also went camping
once or twice. Luckily the books I chose were great!

`Something to Talk About`_: 4/5

This was an exceptional, if not life-changing, romance novel. A big-shot movie director, Jo Jones,
begins to fall for her googly-eyed assistant Emma. I'm a sucker for anything set in SoCal, but even
for those who aren't the plot is thick with interest. The public eye never sleeps in this book, and
the characters have to handle intense pressure throughout their relationship. Not only that, but the
power imbalance between boss and employee raises questions about whether they even *should* get
together. The conflicts in *Something to Talk About* are organic and compelling, while also being
new since I'm certainly not famous enough for anyone to care about who I kiss (if you *are* that
famous OH MY GOD HI!). The result is a fantastic FF romance read that will certainly sweep you away,
while also providing some real substance.

**RIYL**: La La Land, Ali Wong, celebrity memoirs
