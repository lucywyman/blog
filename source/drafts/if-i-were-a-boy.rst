Before coming to college I was completely unaware of 
the diversity problem in STEM.  In high school all 
of my classes were relatively 50-50 in terms of gender, including 
science and math classes, and I had never experienced or noticed
anyone treating me differently than my male or female peers. 
My fist computer science class came as quite a shock, with approximately
5% female attendance*, and as I started to consume more tech-based
media (ie. `Hacker News`_) it became clear the Oregon State was not 
an exception. 

Even after 3 years of classes like this, I'm really not
sure how to feel about the dearth of diversity in STEM.  But 
regardless of the emotions I cycle through or the discussions
I have with people, one question that frequently gets asked is

#. Etherpad "Lucy is naughty"

#. Nibalizer

#. Maker fair


\* This number comes from me very unscientifically counting the number
  of people in class who appeared to be female and asking the professor
  how many students total were in the class.  I understand that appearance
  is not an indicator of gender, and there's possibly errors in 
  mis-identifying individuals, particularly if they're not gender binary.
  I apologize for this, but the point remains the same: the class was 
  *dominated* by male humans
