1. If I had to choose my favorite thing about Eli it's that he makes me
   laugh. Not only is he a funny person, but we have compatible senses of
   humor and enjoy being silly around each other.
2. We spend money the same way. We're both pretty frugal people, and for the
   most part value spending money on the same things (ie. experiences, doing
   things with friends, etc.). We're also both very open about our finances,
   and have similar financial goals. I love that Eli reminds me that money is
   a tool that can sometimes buy happiness, but also doesn't break the bank
   and keeps our long-term dreams in mind. 
3. I love that he's always in my corner. Even when we disagree about something
   I never feel like it's "me vs. him", and...I love that I always feel
   supported, and like even if I mess something up he'll still love me.
4. I love that he is ambitious. Not necessarily in a 'work' sense, but I love
   that Eli always sets big goals for himself and works tirelessly to achieve
   them. Whether it's running a marathon, becoming the networking expert on his
   team at work, or learning how to cook the perfect steak, I love that Eli has
   a clear vision of the person he wants to be and works towards becoming that
   person.
5. I love that he's a dog person (this feels like a cop-out since I don't think
   you can really 'choose' to be a dog person or not but I don't care I love
   that we can have doggos in the future)
6. I love that he's someone I can just talk to. He's not someone I have to
   'translate' my ideas for, or work to talk to. We're on the same wavelength,
   and I love that it's like having our own secret language for expressing
   ideas. Even in this paragraph, we've talked a lot about how we have to
   'translate' when talking to other people, and he's the only person who will
   know exactly what I mean when I say that.
