My education is the foundation upon which my life is built, and has
shaped so many aspects of the person I am today. My career,
my friends, my thoughts and beliefs, all of these were cultivated in
school. I have the privilege of living in a country, a state, and a
city in which I had access to free, high quality education from age 5
to 18.  I had teachers who pushed me to think more critically, who
showed me what doors knowledge could open, who inspired me to be a
better human.  I have always been able to read and write, to express
my ideas and consume the ideas of others.  I have innumerable
resources available to me to continue learning, growing, and improving
throughout my adult life. *Knowledge is power* friends, and I think a
lot of us forget what a *gift* that knowledge is. 

I'll start by saying **education is not synonymous with school**. I have so many friends who take school for granted, see school
as a burden, or as orthogonal to learning and progressing towards
their goals. I have a number of friends who dropped out of college
