I used to listen to stories of women who left tech with a sense of sympathy and gratitude. I was sympathetic to their experiences, and *so glad* I had never experienced the kind of disrespect, discouragement, setbacks, or outright harrassment that they had.

I'm not ready to give up on the industry as a whole, and I still love to code. But I can't keep feeling like my team hates me, like nothing I do is good enough, like everyone is expecting me to immediately succeed and anything less means I'm stupid or lazy or both.
