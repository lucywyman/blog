I don't know about you, but to me March 1st is the unofficial start of spring.
While it may not feel like spring outside just yet, the early sunrises and
budding blossoms reassure us it's on it's way! There were fresh(er)
strawberries on sale at Winco last week, and I nearly leapt with glee right
there in the produce section. With spring (and spring break) coming at us fast,
here's my recommended literary diet (plane and beach approved):

The Grownup
-----------
*Gillian Flynn*

The Cafe by the Sea
-------------------
*Jenny Colgan*

Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance
-----------------------------------------
*Robert M. Pirsig*
