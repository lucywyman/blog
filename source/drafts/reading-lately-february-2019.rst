Oof. February was a literary *slump*. It felt like each book I picked
up was worse than the last. I tried reading `Lake Success`_, `May the
Best Man Win`_, `Girls in White Dresses`_, and `Walking to Listen`_
before finally making it all the way through `Laura and Emma`_ (which
was honestly just okay).

Despite some truly terrible reads, February was a wonderful month!
Well, mostly our `trip to hawaii`_ was wonderful.
