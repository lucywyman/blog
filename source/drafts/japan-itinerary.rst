While `Japanuary`_ was 

**Saturday, January 6th**: We arrived! Our friends were already at the
airbnb we'd be staying in, so we made our way from the airport to our
apartment in the Chiba neighborhood. TODO. We got in around 3 or
4pm, and after settling a bit wanted to try to stay awake despite some
serious jet lag. We went with friends to a $1 sushi place near the
`Shibuya Crossing`_, and were in awe of the bustling city, the
nightlife, and the sheer *vastness* of Tokyo. The $1 sushi was
*amazing*, and we ended up going back several more times before our
trip finished.
**Sunday, January 7th**: After a good night's sleep, we jumped into
the deep end of Tokyo. We spent the day in the `Harajuku`_
neighborhood, visiting `this park`_
