**DISCLAIMER**: My experiences are entirely my own, and don't
necessarily reflect the experiences of others, including other women
at Company X. 

It's no secret that there's an `incredible shortage`_ of women in the
tech industry, and even less of a secret `women`_ `are`_ `treated`_
`differently`_ `than`_ `men`_, particularly in tech (read about `my
experiences with this here`_). This discrimination manifests itself in
a lot of ways, but for the most part it comes down to a single fact:
**we think it's ok to disrespect women**.  Often times this is
completely subconscious, which doesn't absolve us of responsibility
but does point out how deeply ingrained in us sexism and the belief
that women are less-than is. I, too, am guilty of assuming my friend's
pronoun-less colleague is a "he", and taking Bob's arguments over
Alice's even if hers are a little bit strongerÂ¹.  So when I recently
took a job at Company X, I unconsciously expected some of this bias to
color my daily interactions. I didn't even think about it; of course
it was something I would have to deal with. I was a lady programmer at
the bottom of the corporate totem pole. Why should men with 20+ years
of experience in the field listen to me?

So I brought this unconscious and grim expectation with me 

Instead of just exceeding my unconscious and grim expectation, Company X
took my expectation out behind the outhouse and shot it in the head
(too graphic?).  I've had the privilege to work alongside people

[1] Being concious of that bias has helped me stop doing those things,
but it takes time and concious effort to do so.
