Book Review Grading
===================
:slug: grading

Because different grades mean different things to different people,
I wanted to clarify what my scale is when rating books and what I 
look for in great books. Usually it's centered on **how does the
book make me feel**. Do I see the world differently after reading it?
Would I read it again? Was it compelling? 

* **A+**: This is one of my top 10 favorite books, and has changed the
 way I think about or see the world in a fundamental way.
* **A**: 
* **A-**:
* **B+**:
