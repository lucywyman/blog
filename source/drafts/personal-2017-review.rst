What a year! I know so many people who talk about how quickly time moves, but
for me this year (and most years) feel more like decades. I'm not sure why time
moves so slowly for me (and I'm certainly not sad about it!), but thinking back
to last January it feels like a whole lifetime ago. Was it really only 11
months ago that I was marching Portland's streets on a cold and rainy Sunday?
Only 7 months ago I visited Austin? 

Maybe it's because a lot happened this year. Eli graduated! I moved to a new
position at work. We took a road trip to California. But mostly this year has
felt like a lot of waiting. `2016 was a truly life-changing year`_ in so many
ways (some good, some with orange hair), and 2018 will likely be just as
momentous. We're taking a 3 week vacation to JAPAN in January (Japanuary), then
Eli and I are moving to Seattle with 2 good friends and starting our life
together. 2017 has been the in-between year. The middle child of years. The
long-distance-relationship, long-work-hours,
long-time-waiting-for-Eli-to-graduate year. Perhaps that's why it's moved so
slowly?

But, while 2017 may not be as remarkable as the years that surround it, it's
worth reflecting on. Here goes.

**What am I most proud of?**
Honestly, and this is something I'm really ashamed of, but I lost (and kept
off) 20 pounds. I'm not ashamed of the fact of it so much as that I wanted to
lose weight in the first place (and still want to). It feels vain to care so
much about being thin, and also weak, like I've let society tell me what it
means to be beautiful instead of defining it for myself. 

**What area did I struggle with the most? And what lesson did I learn from that struggle?**
Similarly, I struggled the most with my weight (this is true of every year
since I was 12). To be perfectly honest, I think my weight gets to me so much
simply because I don't have better things to worry about. In a lot of ways,
it's a good problem to have and I recognize that. At the same time, it
constantly pervades my thoughts, and I want to try to build a healthier
relationship with food.

**What are my 3 happiest memories?**
1. Spending the day with my mom at The Grove. Although our early-December trip
   was already planned, my grandpa died just weeks before we were scheduled to
   visit. He was 94, lived a good and long life, but it was still a blow to my
   mom. We had a few days to spend in LA before the funeral, and while we
   should probably have spent more time helping my grandma move things or
   visiting other relatives we did what my grandpa would have wanted us to do:
   eat cake, shop, and gaze in awe at the beautiful people of LA. It was just
   the perfect day in the sun with my mom, despite all the sadness.
2. Dinner at Fogo de Chao to celebrate Eli's graduation. I *love* food, and
   while I don't eat a lot of red meat I definitely appreciate a good meal. And
   this was the best! Going to FdC felt really special, we were there for 3+
   hours, the food was amazing and it was great to celebrate with Eli's family.
   Definitely a special meal.
3. 

**What did I accomplish?**

**When was I the most scared? Would I handle that fear the same or differently?**
A few months ago I scraped another car in the parking lot of a grocery store
while pulling out of a spot, and at the time hoping the noise was just from the
podcast I was playing I drove merrily off. Getting a call from my mom saying
the police were at my parents house later that night was terrifying. I wasn't
sure what would happen, what kind of trouble I would be in, or how furious my
parents would be. I know I should feel bad for the person who likely has a
streak of red paint on their car now, thanks to me, but I honestly just felt
like people cared too much about their cars and that as long as it was still
driveable the police should really not have been involved. It was a moment that
made me realize how much I really hate driving, and hope that in the near
future I won't need to own or ride in a car *ever*. Can self-driving cars come
any faster? 

That said, if I had it to do again I really wish I had been more adult about
the whole thing. I should have gotten out to check. I should have left a note
with my insurance information I guess. But it's a situation where it feels bad
to do the right thing, and I blame the insurance industry for that. 

**What habit did I form or break that Iâ€™ll continue next year?**
I started logging all the food I eat this year, and hope to continue to do
that. Keeping track of what I eat definitely helps me control my food intake,
and also not over eat. Good for my body and wallet :)

**Who made my heart flutter?**
Eli, obviously.

**Who did I spend the majority of my time with? Was that energizing or draining?**
Eli, obviously. I love spending time with Eli. He calms me and my anxiety,
grounds me, and I feel so at ease when I'm with him, like there's no where else
I *need* to be or anything else I *should* be doing. It's like I can't really
rest unless Eli is there. 

**What new skills, hobbies or activities did I try this year?**
I took a salsa class! I'm so glad I took it, but I also didn't renew it after
the first month. I think, ultimately, I just need to make time to do fun things
like that. I think Zumba might be in my future? We'll see once we move to
Seattle.

**What was my most magical moment in nature?**
Getting to the top of the peak at crater lake and eating PB.

**When was I the most fully expressed version of myself? When was I not (and why) ?**
**When did I do something wonderful for someone?**
**When did I allow myself to be helped by someone else?**
**What moment brought me the most joy at work?**
**How did I take care of my health? And in what ways did I ignore it?**
**What money was the best spent? And what money was wasted?**
**What is one thing I created this year?**
**Is there anything to anyone left unsaid?**
**Who or what am I the most grateful for?**
**What surprised me the most?**
**When did I stand up for what I believe in?**
**Where have I healed?**
**What do I know for sure (about myself, about life, about love, etc) ?**
