The `Tournament of Books`_ happened this month, and while I knew I
wouldn't get through all the books I did try for as many as I could
that were available at the library. 

`Warlight`_
-----------
*Michael Ondaatje*

This isn't usually the type of book I'd pick up, and honestly
reminded me why I don't read 'artsy' books as much. While I can see
the appeal of Ondaatje's ethereal settings, elusive characters, and
vivid setting descriptions, it's weird to dedicate so many words to
the strange details of a story (the dog race scene? What?) instead of
the plot or characters. I suppose that's the appeal - it just isn't
for me. Ultimately a good book, and good to get out of my comfort
zone, but I won't be coming back.

`Census`_
---------
*Jesse Ball*

Ha! And I thought 'Warlight' was artsy. 'Census' was way too abstract
for a casual reader such as myself

`Surprise Me`_

I was (appropriately) surprised by how much I liked this book! I
expected it to be a meaningless fling of a book, the kind of thing you
read when there's nothing else to read. The depth of the heroine's
character, the plot twists and gut wrenches in her story, and the
relatable setting all made this a very enjoyable read! I wouldn't go
so far as to say I loved it, or it changed my life or anything. I'm
not even sure I'd recommend it. But I would definitely not discourage
people from reading it, and hope you'll also find it entertaining.

`Remedial Rocket Science`_
--------------------------
*Susannah Nix*

As a lady software engineer, I thought a romance novel with this title
could not disappoint. Apparently I learned nothing from 'Big Bang
Theory': tech-themed media is *so hard* to get right. While the
technical details of the book are pretty good, the characters fall
totally flat. The heroine gives all appearance of being a 'strong
female lead', then ends up falling for a guy who's clearly beneath
her? I didn't really get it - Jeremy was a mostly-loser, and she could
have done *way* better. Skip this sorry feminist-wannabe.
