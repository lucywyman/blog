Hello beautiful reader! Summer is upon us, and with long sunny days ahead
you know you'll be tripping to Powell's to pick up some summer reads. 
I have a few recommendations fiction for 


* `The Harry Potter Series`_. Depending on your appetite this series can take
   a while, but I recently re-read the whole series and `loved it`_. Definitely
   worth revisiting if you haven't in a while, or if you've never read them
   to begin with.
* `The Help`_. If you haven't already, you should.
* `Committed`_, `Big Magic`_, or `Eat, Pray, Love`_. 
  You've definitely heard of the last one, but
  the first is *so much better*. Elizabeth Gilbert is 100% my favorite author,
  my guilty pleasure, my comfort food, and her voice is miraculous. I like her
  non-fiction better than her fiction (just personally, no literary criticism
  here), but anything she writes will definitely lift your day.
* Anything by `David Sedaris`_.

Biographies & Memoirs:
----------------------

I know, but I just love them so much...

* `Furiously Happy`_. I'm not sure if this qualifies as a biography, but it
  seems close enough. I've read *several* comedic ladies biographies (
  `Bossypants`_, `Yes Please`_, `Seriously, I'm Kidding`_, 
  `Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?`_, etc.) and though hilarious and 
  inspiring I find the story often gets lost in the authors trying to be 
  funny. Granted being funny in writing (even in an audiobook) is like marathon
  level hard. But `Jenny Lawson`_ definitely pulls it off in her reading of 
  her second book "Furiously Happy". 
* `Still Alice`_. It's so hard to understand living with mental illness, and
  Still Alice paints a vivid picture of sinking into early onset Alzheimers.
  There were so many points where you think "This could be me, or someone 
  I love", and it gives you real empathy and compassion for those battling
  mental illness. 
* `Orange is the New Black`_. I *love* the show, but it definitely takes 
  a lot of artistic license. Piper's actual experience, though less exciting,
  is fascinating and well-told.
* `The Audacity of Hope`_. Perfect for a quick weekend read, Obamas cool
  personal story and charismatic voice make this feel good, palate-cleanser
  sort of book. Remind yourself there's good in the world.
* `I Am Malala`_.
