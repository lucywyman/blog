The Impossible Twitter Handle Quest

Honestly I prefer Instagram. Privacy concerns aside I haven't used
Facebook since it was taken over by my parents, and have never enjoyed
the short-form shouting-into-the-void of Twitter. The tech industry
does, though, and I've increasingly found myself tweeting and being
tweeted at for work. I wouldn't say I'm quite a "brand" yet, but as
the `project I work on`_ grows social media presence is becoming more
important, and I'm becoming more of a recognized figure in the
community. When I first joined Twitter I never anticipated this, so
chose the fun handle @cookingandcode - an alliterative combination of
two things I enjoyed. Once I started using Twitter for work I switched
to the more professional @lucycwyman, since @lucywyman and @lucy_wyman
were both taken and I assumed most of my activity would be limited to
people I knew in person. However there are 2 key problems with
@lucycwyman:

1. If you're reading quickly it's easy to miss the middle-C
2. @lucywyman profile picture looks *enough* like me that, especially
   if you don't know me personally, you could mistake her for me.

    You can probably see why I don't want my professional twitter
    conflated with this one.

Since @lucywyman hasn't been active for about 4 years now, I decided
it was time to see if I could claim the handle and avoid future
handle-mishaps.

Step 1: Twitter Support
-----------------------

The most obvious approach was to go through Twitter support. Their
documentation is clear though: unless you *own* the trademark for a
handle and can make an airtight case for it, you're SOL.

TODO QUOTE

However, despite this disappointing beginning to my quest I was
briefly buoyed by `this blog post`_, which detailed TODO's successful
acquisition of TODO through Twitter support. I didn't directly
copy-paste but wrote a very similar plea to Twitter, laying out
why I wanted the handle and including my ID. I got a response about 2
hours later: no dice.

Step 2: Finding Lucy Wyman
--------------------------

So Twitter wasn't going to help me, but perhaps the other Lucy Wyman
would be sympathetic to my plight and willing to delete her account. I
spent about an hour one Sunday morning going through LinkedIn and Facebook
trying to match Lucy Wyman profiles to the Twitter profile. The top
LinkedIn profile seemed promising - @lucywyman had a few tweets that
seemed to indicate she was in cooking school, and this Lucy Wyman was
a professional chef.

I sent her a LinkedIn message briefly explaining the situation and
asking what she thought. After a week of radio silence I had given up,
and was ready to start reaching out to her twitter-friends, when she
responded to my message!
