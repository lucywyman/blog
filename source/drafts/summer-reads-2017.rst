Summer is still a month away. But here in Oregon it's been raining for about 6 weeks straight now and dreaming of long days and sunshine is all that's getting me through. With long, lazy weekends ahead, now is the perfect time to start compiling a reading list! Here's what I've been loving lately:

`Kitchens of the Great Midwest`_ is just about the sweetest book.
Following the life of Eva Thorvald through the eyes of those around

*By Chip and Joanna Gaines*

I know I know I know I know I know. Judge all you want, I am
head-over-heels for Chip and Joanna Gaines, and their book `The
Magnolia Story`_ did not disappoint. They're so funny! And cute!
Perfect for beach reading and flower gazing.

retelling is 

The Bell Jar
------------
*By Sylvia Plath*

This book was anything but! Plath's semi-autobiographical novel is the beautiful story of a young woman trying to find her
