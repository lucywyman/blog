You read right: I only own one belt.  I've always struggled to `find
pants`_ that fit my waist, hips, and butt, so a belt is an essential
part of keeping everything PG.  I decided to dedicate my
post-Christmas shopping to finding a solid, basic, well-made belt and
scored big time.  The belt is an `Alfani men's belt`_, double-sided
black and brown with a reversible buckle.  There are a lot of reasons
it's perfect:

1. It matches anything, and solidly anchors any outfit.
2. It has enough holes that it easily fits around the widest part of
   my hips (with one extra hole even!) as well as the smallest part
   of my waist (for dresses and skirts).
3. It isn't flimsy, and doesn't crease or fold when worn.

Once I got home, I realized I didn't need any of my mis-matched 
menagerie of other belts.  Purple with a pretty clasp?  Thin woven
cognac?  Big-buckle?  All out.  I'm not generally a only-have-one
kind of gal, but I can say that I never long for another belt
with this one around!
