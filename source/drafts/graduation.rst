In just one short week I'll be graduating from university, and honestly I'm
still not sure how to sort out all of my emotions about it. I thought writing
this blog post would help me process and refine some of my thoughts on the next
few months, but it's been like a month since I actually started writing this
and I'm still on the second sentence. So, let's see if we can do this.

My most overwhelming emotion is **excitement**.  I am *so ready* to be done
with arbitrary deadlines, C and assembly, exams, submitting my work for grading
instead of getting constructive feedback, the stress, the fear.  I know that my
future job won't be perfect, but I do trust that it will be creative and
meaningful in a way that school just isn't.  I'm excited to start this new
phase of my life, to meet new people and try new things, and have new
experiences, blee blah, all the normal stuff. That said, I've definitely
learned a lot at university. Even more than that, **I've changed a lot** in the
last three years, which adds to the weird emotional turducken I'm experiencing.  

What's more, each time I think about things I'll miss about university, they're
things that aren't unique to university.  Midnight pizza? Going to the gym with
friends? Playing `Coupe`_ and drinking wine? None of that ends this June.
There are so many "lasts" right now: last class, last test, last paper, last
late-night study session **EVER**.  But it's not the end of learning, or
growing, or even of my education.  

What's missing from my emotional smörgåsbord is melancholy.  It really doesn't
even feel bittersweet, and I feel strangely numb about the end of 
my formal schooling career. I think I should feel more...*something*....but
I just don't.  As college graduates we've been in school
for our entire concious lives up to this point, but it doesn't feel like this
momentous ending, or even a tremendous accomplishment. It just feels like life
will go on as it has been, but with more choices and more money and more
freedom. What's there to be sad about?

Lessons
-------

* Just show up. Even if a class doesn't feel worthwhile, professors know who
  attends, and will say helpful things that aren't in the textbook.
* 

I'll leave you with a quote from Taylor Swift: "Honey, life is just a
classroom".
