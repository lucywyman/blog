In just three short weeks I'll be graduating from university, and honestly
I'm still not sure how to sort out all of my emotions about it. I thought
writing this blog post would help me process and refine some of my 
thoughts on the next few months, but it's been like two weeks since I actually
started writing this and I'm still on the second sentence. So, let's see if
we can do this.

My most overwhelming emotion is **excitement**.  I am *so ready* to be done
with arbitrary deadlines, C and assembly, exams, submitting my work for 
grading instead of getting constructive feedback, the stress, the fear.
I know that my future job won't be perfect, but I do trust that it will
be creative and meaningful in a way that school just isn't.

That said, I've definitely learned a lot at university. Even more than that,
**I've changed a lot** in the last three years, which adds to the weird
emotional turducken I'm experiencing. 

I'll leave you with a quote from Taylor Swift: "Honey, life is just a classroom".
