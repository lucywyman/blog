When you can't count on anyone else, count on Alyssa Cole to write a
*fucking amazing* romance novel. Each one is better than the last! Her
characters are so layered, complex, and rich.

This was such a refreshing and smart YA read. I loved the voice and
confidence of Emoni, and loved how real the story, conflicts, and
characters were. It didn't feel overdone or dramatic, and it was
unexpected yet realistic how casual Emoni was about having a baby, and
how much she loved her baby. Highly recommended for young adults and
old adults alike!
