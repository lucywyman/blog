This year's `Southern California Linux Expo`_ was a bit weird for me
personally. I felt unusually anxious and pressured, and it put a
strain on the trip.

.. _Southern California Linux Expo: 

I felt pressure from my team to evangelize our tool and justify going
to the conference. My company has always been supportive of me
speaking at conferences, even if it isn't about technology related to
what we do, and our community and evangelism team is *still* very
supportive. I expressed anxiety about whether it was worth going and
was swiftly and emphatically told that going to conferences and
representing the company is important, and helps embed us in the
community. To boot, this trip was relatively cheap, especially
compared to being a sponsor or having a booth. But that positive
feedback isn't there from the team I'm working on. I haven't gotten
negative feedback about it either, so this is most likely just my
brain being mean and telling me that their silence is disapproval and
disdain. But I felt like I had to be hustling and evangelizing the
tool, rather than just enjoying the conference and learning.

I also felt anxiety after burning out on conferences last year. When I
lived alone getting to travel was exciting, and I loved seeing friends
at the conferences I went to. I started going to more and more which
culminated in me speaking at 7 conferences last year, which was just
way too many. I also don't enjoy the travel as much anymore because
it's time away from my home and my tiny boyfriend+dog+roommates
family, and many of my friends stopped going to conferences. I decided
to scale back my talk applications *a lot* in 2019, but had already
been accepted to SCaLE. 

While I was excited to see my friends and give a talk I love to give
at SCaLE, I was also kind of dreading it. 

Goals for the Trip
------------------

So with all of this in mind I had a few goals for the trip.

1. Evangelize Bolt, and more concretely give out all the ~40 stickers I
  had. I'm genuinely excited about Bolt, and was stoked to talk to
  people about it, so expected this would just happen.
2. Learn more about successful open source communities, and get ideas
  for how to improve our own open source community. I think much of
  our success as a project will hinge on our community health, and
  fostering that is my 'specialization' on the team. Plus it's hard!

Day 0
-----

I flew in to LA *way* too early. The conference technically starts
Thursday, but talks start on Friday and it doesn't really get going
until Saturday. I knew this, so I booked my ticket for Thursday
afternoon thinking I'd go to the conference Friday. I then proceeded
to have a bunch of meetings scheduled on Friday, and got pretty sick.
As a result I spent Friday working from my AirBnB. Woops. One day in
and my feelings of failure and anxiety were only getting worse.

Day 1
-----

Saturday! I finally made it to the actual conference about 36 hours
after landing in LA - a lesson learned in travel booking. I have mixed
feelings about how the day went overall. I wore a `Bolt`_ sticker on
my forehead all day in an attempt to achieve goal #1 and get people to
ask me about it. All the people I already knew did indeed ask about
it, but everyone I didn't know just glanced at me then quickly looked
away and acted busy. Rather than starting conversations the sticker
just seemed to be kind of weird. I maintain that it's a good idea, and
it was kind of fun and whimsical for a day, but alas did not have the
desired effect.

Speaking of people I know, I got to see some wonderful humans!
Reconnecting and catching up with long-distance friends is by far the
best part of going to conferences, and a few folks I hadn't seen in a
while were at SCaLE. I won't name names, but I saw no less than 5
good friends and had a great time talking about our lives and tech. It
reminded me why I love being a part of the open source community, why
I love going to conferences, and that people are so good.

I also went to some AMAZING talks. I was so distracted by my work
anxiety that I didn't realize how AWESOME the talks were until I sat
down to write this post. They gave me so many ideas for how to make
our project better and more successful, provided solace and
perspective on how long and how much work open source communities
take, and were all excellent presentations and presenters. Each one
was clearly well practiced, thoughtful, and had great takeaways.

`Growing HashiCorp From Dorm Room OSS`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Mitchell Hashimoto*
 
Mitchell's keynote was the story of starting Vagrant at university
and how that grew into Hashicorp, including details about the
products, his personal role during each 'era', finances, and the
community. It was equal parts about community organization, starting a
business, technical career arcs, and creating great software, and had
helpful information on each of these topics. A few takeaways resonated
with me:

* Part of Vagrant's initial success was creating a 'magical' first
 experience, or a sense of 'wow' in the first 15 minutes. Mitchell
 said to focus on a constrained use case and then make that user
 experience *amazing*. I want to think more about that initial
 experience with Bolt, and what that constrained use case might be.
* Mitchell talked about growing Vagrant's user base by interacting in
 person with the community. This eased my anxiety about attending the
 conference a bit, and while I'm sure it'd be better if I was giving
 a talk about Bolt I think that establishing credibility and place in
 the community will pay dividends in the long run. Plus, focusing on
 making our community a positive place and having in-person
 interactions are important.
* He also talked about outsourcing the parts of the job you don't
 like. He realized Vagrant had outgrown just him when he was
 writing code for other people, not to solve his own problems. I
 think we struggle with this as a dev team who doesn't use our own
 tool as part of our jobs.
* Lastly he talked about monetizing Vagrant, specifically with paid
 plugins. We haven't really considered this for Bolt and I think it
 could work really well - as he put it, there's a clean
 separation between what's paid and what isn't, and an OSS user
 can just recreate their own OSS version if they want so it
 doesn't limit usability.

If you have an hour to spare I think this talk is worth watching.

`25 things I wish I knew before becoming a community organizer`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Jason Hibbets*

Jason's talk was kind of like a horoscope - vague enough that
everyone could identify with it, but not actually actionable. BUT
during the Q and A he had some interesting thoughts on how to measure
the value of community events, and on how to recognize and appreciate
contributions.

Jason talked about measuring event impact by the numbers, though it's
more of an art than a science. They best you can really do is collect:
* How many people came to your talk
* How many people talk to you afterwards
* Who did you connect more deeply with
* Who did you follow up with
This is something we're thinking about more on the community team at
Puppet, and if nothing else it was heartening to hear that other teams
struggle to quantify this.

In terms of recognizing contributors opensource.com uses a points and
badges system, which I'm not sure would work for our project but it
did get me thinking about recognizing individuals within our
community. I think our challenge will be determining what our
community values and how they would want to be recognized, whether
it's in thoughtful, direct messages (ie. handwritten thank yous) or in
a more public way. 

Lots of good food for thought from this talk, if not a lot of concrete
actions.

`Embarrassingly Large Numbers: Salary Negotiation for Humans`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Corey Quinn, Sonia Gupta*

Besides that I would see Corey Quinn talk about anything on any day,
this was *especially* apt since my partner got a job offer on FRIDAY,
not even 24 hours earlier. I took copious notes, I laughed, I was
inspired. I'm not sure I can adequately summarize, so I'll only
recommend that you watch the talk yourself if it applies to you. Or
you just need a pick-me-up.

Day 2
-----

State of the OSU Open Source Lab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Lance Albertson*

Having worked at the `OSL`_ I wanted to see what the Lab had been up
to. I'll be honest...I could maybe have skipped this talk. But my
former boss, Lance, is a great director and one of the nicest people I
know, so I didn't feel bad about showing up just to be a friendly face
in the (small) crowd.

My Talk
~~~~~~~

My talk went...ok? Self assessment is so hard. I watched the version
of this talk I gave `at OSCON`_ and holy cannoli did I have my sh*t
together for that talk. This time around, much less so. I was sick, I
hadn't practiced as much as I wanted to, I was tired and ready to go
home. Excuse excuse excuse. Nothing overtly terrible happened though,
and I think I'm only so critical because I have that previous version
to compare to. On the plus side this talk was an hour so I had more
time to explain concepts in depth, and didn't have to rush through the
end. Also on the plus side there were a lot of people who were very
engaged, especially for a post-lunch talk, and I was asked many good
questions. I also love this topic because it's mathy and interesting
and easy to explain and understand yet somehow people are impressed
it? Whatever my own thoughts, the feedback I got from the audience was
only positive, and no one left in the middle, so...I'll call it a win.

By the numbers:
* ~100 attendees
* 6 people talked to me afterwards

Other Interactions
------------------

I'm not sure how to categorize this, but I had some good conversations
with folks. The best was I spoke to Josh Berkus, the organizer of an
Ansible meetup in PDX, and he suggested I present a Bolt vs. Ansible
comparison there. I also talked to a Bolt user (JJ Ashnar) who was
using Bolt to run Chef. And it may not be worth a lot, but I did give
out ~10 bolt stickers and get one university student really riled up
to install Bolt once he got home. Again, on the 'Evangelize Bolt'
front I feel like I ~failed~ learned a lot about how to do it better
at the next conference.

Takeaways
---------

With that I left SCaLE having succeeded in goal #2 and mostly failed
in goal #1. 

While I may not have achieved the goals I set out for myself, SCaLE
17x was a great reminder that friends are pretty awesome,
and that maintaining relationships takes time and effort. I love my
conference friends, and while they might not go and install Bolt today
(especially since most of them work for our competitors) they are
invaluable parts of my life - people I care about and who care about
me. I think I went into SCaLE focused on professional success, and
forgot about what will help me lead a better and more fulfilling life.
In that sense, the weekend was great (although I do really miss Eli
and Luna. I'm currently on the plane and oh my god I can't wait to be
home).
