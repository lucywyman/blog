Powell's Books
--------------

In the digital age, as book stores around the world close their doors,
`Powell's`_ remains a thriving hub of literature.  Even if you haven't
picked up a book in years, Powell's will remind you of the power books
have over us, and make you thirsty for knowledge.  You'll be wandering
aimlessly, not sure what there is for you there, then find yourself
thinking 'I bet that vegetarian cookbook would help me cook at home
more instead of getting takeout', or 'Oooo, I haven't read Phillip K.
Dick in years. I used to love his books', and the game is over. The
book worm, occasional beach reader, skeptical technophile, child,
grandparent, and even dog will inevitably find themselves drawn to one
of Powell's 1 million books and fall in love all over again.  Even if
you just come for the corgi-socks, it's worth the visit! 

Rose Test Garden
----------------

The `International Rose Test Garden`_ is one of the most traditionally
beautiful places in Portland.  With several football fields of roses
(I don't know how many) and several hundred million types of roses (jk
jk), it's easy to lose all sense of time and space amidst the
fragrance and brilliance of the Rose Test Garden. All kidding aside,
the RTG is a must during the summer months when roses are in full
bloom.
