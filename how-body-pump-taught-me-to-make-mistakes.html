<h2>How Body Pump Taught Me To Make Mistakes</h2>
<p>04.25.2016</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody makes mistakes, Everybody has those days.  Everbody knows what, what
I'm talking about, Everybody gets that way&quot;</p>
<p>You've heard it before: No one is perfect, and everyone makes mistakes. But
it's a hard lesson to internalize, especially when it seems like everyone else
is Succeeding with a capital S. I started teaching
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.lesmills.com/us/workouts/fitness-classes/bodypump/">Body Pump</a> a year ago, and remember all the nerves I had as I was just
starting.  [Body Pump is a choreographed weight-lifting class, and as a teacher
my job was to memorize the choreography and instruct participants on having
good lifting form]?.  After my first team-teaching with a veteran
instructor, she looked me in the eye and said &quot;Don't apologize if you mess up.
You own the room, you're in control, you're calling the shots. If you mess up,
just keep going&quot;.  As a BP regular for many years I had noticed that all the
instructors did this, but it was hard to train myself not to apologize for
missing a &quot;2 and 2&quot; cue.</p>
<p>That was the magic of Body Pump. By reframing the apology as a bad
thing that took away from the participants experience, I realized that
apologizing for small mistakes that didn't hurt anyone was silly.  <strong>I realized
that if I wanted my peers to take me seriously, and to be respected in my
community that I had to make decisions and statements with certainty, and not
apologize for any imperfections.</strong> Moving past small mistakes with grace
has helped me focus on more important things in my life, and stop editing
myself so much in my interactions.  I've realized that misspelling a word,
not catching a joke, or [forgetting someone's name]? do not warrant sorrys. By
refraining from apology in those instances I command more respect, not
just from other people but from myself.  Which leads to the second big lesson
I learned in Body Pump: <strong>Respect yourself, and other people will too</strong>.</p>
<p>One year later I have my own newly-trained instructors teaching with me, and
they're a weekly reminder of how much I've grown in the last year. It's easy
to get caught in the routine, and forget how much confidence it takes to
get up early, stand in front of people, remember your &quot;2 and 2&quot; cues, and
teach unapologetically. Instructors and participants alike show up to
Body Pump for the same reason: to get stronger.</p>
