<h2>Reading Lately: February 2020</h2>
<p>03.18.2020</p>
<div class='parent'>
  <img alt="" src="/theme/images/february-2020.jpg" style="height: 400px;">
</div>
<p>I'm writing this March 22, 2020, and February feels like it was years ago. In
retrospect it was a blissfully tactile month! We <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/cancun-trip.html">visited Cancun</a> for my
birthday, which was fantastic despite being very different than we had
expected. The best part was when we got back spring felt within reach - the
worst of winter behind us. Little did we know the world would shut down in mere
weeks. Here's what I read, in blissful ignorance:</p>
<div class="section" id="things-you-save-in-a-fire-5-5">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41150382-things-you-save-in-a-fire">Things You Save in a Fire</a>: 5/5</h2>
<p><em>Katherine Center</em></p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="theme/images/things-you-save-in-a-fire.jpg" style="height: 300px;" />
</div>
<p><em>This</em> is the modern romance I always hope to read but never quite get. The
heroine, Cassie Hanwell, is a firefighter who through personal and professional
circumstance has to leave her friendly Texas firehouse for an openly sexist,
old-school new gig in Boston. Highly accomplished characters tend to be
annoying and unrealistic - practically every high school graduate in literature
seems to go to Yale or Harvard regardless of how smart they actually are. But
Cassie is genuinely inspiring, both in her smarts, her calm during emergencies,
and her physical strength. She renewed my belief I could someday do a pull-up
(someday...in the future), at the same time being genuinely likable and flawed.
She's the absolute star of the book, and her crush on a fellow Boston
firefighter is downright adorable.</p>

<h2><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39280445-nine-perfect-strangers">Nine Perfect Strangers</a>: 4/5</h2>
<p><em>Liane Moriarty</em></p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="theme/images/nine-perfect-strangers.jpg" style="height: 300px;" />
</div>
<p>If you've read and loved Liane before - particularly her grittier works, like
&quot;Big Little Lies&quot; or &quot;The Husband's Secret&quot; - &quot;Nine Perfect Strangers&quot; may be a
bit disappointing. It has so many hallmarks of Moriarty's work: the
upper-middle class Australian setting, the complex and underestimated
characters (particularly women), the 'dramatic' final scene, though more of a
whimper than a bang. Luckily what I love about her books are the fabulously
compelling characters, which this had in spades (well...twelve of them at
least. &quot;WHY NOT NINE?&quot; You'll see). While NPS was a slow burn, I was strung
along wanting to know what would happen to the secretly lonely romance author,
the just-dumped soccer mom, and most of all the crazy Russian guru. Despite
the lack of plot there's mounting tension from the first chapter that keeps you
guessing until the climax, which honestly for me excused the disappointment of
that important scene. It's a great read, better if you don't compare it to the
author's other novels.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-authenticity-project-4-5">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42592725-the-authenticity-project">The Authenticity Project</a>: 4/5</h2>
<p><em>Clare Pooley</em></p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="theme/images/authenticity-project.png" style="height: 300px;" />
</div>
<p>Another ensemble, multiple narrator read, my favorite part of &quot;The
Authenticity Project&quot; is that the plot never went quite where I expected. It
starts out like so many saccharine, feel good novels, and then morphs into
something entirely different by adding layers of complexity and nuance to each
character. Even the most sympathetic cast members are deeply flawed in the
end, and those who claim &quot;authenticity&quot; find it much harder to practice than
preach. This book also has a much more optimistic view of millenial culture
than some of it's Brit-fic contemporaries, which makes it less exasperating and
more balanced. It's hardly a 'must-read', but you won't regret reading it if
you panic-buy it at the airport.</p>

<div class="section" id="i-like-to-watch-3-5">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42815538-i-like-to-watch">I Like to Watch</a>: 3/5</h2>
<p><em>Emily Nussbaum</em></p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="theme/images/i-like-to-watch.jpg" style="height: 300px;" />
</div>
<p>While the prose of Nussbaum's essays is delightful, the content is sadly hollow
if you haven't seen (or closely watched) the TV shows she discusses. This seems
obvious in hindsight, but given I grew up watching TV about 10 years after
Nussbaum our cultural references and holy grail TV shows are just slightly off
from each other. For example, 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' was the show that
changed TV for Nussbaum, while I didn't see it until I was rewatching old shows
on Hulu earlier this year. Needless to say it had a different impact for each
of us. I think if you watch a lot of TV, and are either 30+ or were allowed to
watch The Sopranos before you were 10, this book will scratch itches you didn't
know you had. It'll make you rethink the shows you love, give you a new
perspective, and put the show in it's cultural context. But if you're not? Your
time is better spent watching 'The Good Place' (EVEN IF YOU'RE A BOOK PERSON
NOT A TV PERSON TRUST ME).</p>

<h2><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44019067-the-bromance-book-club">The Bromance Book Club</a>: 3/5</h2>
<p><em>Lyssa Kay Adams</em></p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="theme/images/bromance-book-club.jpg" style="height: 300px;" />
</div>
<p>I'm starting to think I don't like romance novels. But if I don't like romance
novels, what <em>do</em> I like? This book made me question who I am.</p>
<p>While chick lit rarely claims to be realistic, this book is pure fantasy. It's
not unpleasant but it is distracting, like a superhero movie with bad CGI. When
baseball all-star Gavin Scott learns his wife (and mother of his 2 daughters)
has been faking orgasms for years he's understandably upset, though more about
his ego than about her. The fight breaks their already strained relationship,
and the rest of the book follows him trying to fight his macho instincts and
win her back. In general I like the arc of rebuilding a broken relationship
more than the hate-to-love trope, but the characters weren't especially likable
and the whole book reeked of gender norms. The worst part of the book was it's
conceit: a group of male pro-athletes who read romance novels and teach each
other how to treat women based on those romance novels. The bit wouldn't be so
bad if it was written more honestly, and less like an Adam Sandler movie- <em>Isn't it soooooo ridiculous to think of grown men reading romance novels? Hahaha</em> 😐.</p>
<p>I may be harshing the mellow too much - this book was below expectations, but
overall was a perfectly vanilla modern romance.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-nature-fix-3-5">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30231812-the-nature-fix">The Nature Fix</a>: 3/5</h2>
<p><em>Florence Williams</em></p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="theme/images/nature-fix.jpg" style="height: 300px;" />
</div>
<p>This book is a very long, citation laden way of saying &quot;Go outside&quot;. It's
central question is captivating: <em>why</em> is nature so good for us? But the dearth
of answers is unsatisfying - we only know all the ways in which it's good for
us, but it's hard to determine precisely why. For example we know,
✨scientifically✨, that the smell of eucalyptus and lavender are calming, but
can only guess at why those plants cause that reaction in our brains. I'm all
about the message of the book, and about making access to nature a right and
not a privilege. But honestly, I read this a month ago and cannot tell you one
thing I remember from it.</p>

<h2><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9791.A_Walk_in_the_Woods">A Walk in the Woods</a>: 3/5</h2>
<p><em>Bill Bryson</em></p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="theme/images/a-walk-in-the-woods.jpg" style="height: 300px;" />
</div>
<p>After loving <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43582376-the-body">The Body: A Guide for Occupants</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/135611.Shakespeare">Shakespeare: The World as
Stage</a> by Bryson, I felt betrayed by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9791.A_Walk_in_the_Woods">A Walk in the Woods</a>. Firstly I do not
care for Katz, Bryson's ill-prepared and impulsive companion, at all. I do not
understand why Bryson tolerated his irrational decisions, lack of endurance, or
very presence at all. More than Katz, this book is missing what I love so much
about Bryson's other books: fascinating stories doused with his own brand of
insight. The book felt two-dimensional compared to &quot;The Body&quot; or &quot;Shakespeare&quot;,
merely an account of what happened instead of a commentary on nature and the
human spirit. You're better off reading the appropriately more famed <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12262741-wild">Wild</a> by
Cheryl Strayed.</p>
