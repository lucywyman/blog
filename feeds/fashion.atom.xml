pants&lt;/a&gt; that fit my waist, hips, and butt, so a belt is an essential
part of keeping everything PG.  I decided to dedicate my
post-Christmas shopping to finding a solid, basic, well-made belt and
scored big time.  The belt is an &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www1.macys.com/shop/product/alfani-reversible-calf-leather-belt?ID=1385277"&gt;Alfani men's belt&lt;/a&gt;, double-sided
black and brown with a reversible buckle.  There are a lot of reasons
it's perfect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It matches anything, and solidly anchors any outfit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has enough holes that it easily fits around the widest part of
my hips (with one extra hole even!) as well as the smallest part
of my waist (for dresses and skirts).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It isn't flimsy, and doesn't crease or fold when worn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="static/belt/upclose-belt.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I got home, I realized I didn't need any of my mis-matched
menagerie of other belts.  Purple with a pretty clasp?  Thin woven
cognac?  Big-buckle?  All out.  I'm not generally a only-have-one
kind of gal, but I can say that I never long for another belt
with this one around!&lt;/p&gt;

filling out &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.un-fancy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/capsuleplanner_2016.pdf"&gt;Caroline Rector's Capsule Planner&lt;/a&gt;, I found
a color palette that most of my closet fit into and a few essentials
that I was in need of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 pairs of jeans. At the time I had 3, which just wasn't enough now
that I wear them most days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sweaters. I only have 1 (!) sweater, and since I get cold so easily
I knew I needed more (how did I even survive last winter???)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A light raincoat. I have a heavy-duty trench perfect for those
really bad days, but am lacking a light water-proof coat for those
mild-but-wet days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A flannel. I've never considered myself a flannel person, but
thought it was worth trying this season.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flats!  I've always just bought cheap plastic flats from Payless,
getting new ones every 3-9 months, and decided it was time to stop
that nonsense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So! Shopping list in hand, mom and I headed to the Woodburn Outlet
mall for some serious shopping.  4 hours and infinite dressing rooms
later, we emerged elated and victorious!  Here's what I got:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/levis.jpg" style="height: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 pairs of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.ghbass.com/product/susie+casual+flat.do?sortby=ourPicks&amp;amp;from=fn"&gt;Susie Casual Flats&lt;/a&gt;, one in black and one in red ($12 each)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.ghbass.com/product/matilda+flat+ii.do?sortby=ourPicks&amp;amp;from=fn"&gt;The Matilda Flat&lt;/a&gt; in black ($48) and cognac ($12)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.levi.com/US/en_US/womens-jeans/p/188820023"&gt;Levi's High Rise Skinny Jeans&lt;/a&gt; ($40)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.ae.com/women-aeo-crew-jegging-sweater-purple/web/s-prod/0348_7204_500?cm=sUS-cUSD&amp;amp;catId=cat6470515"&gt;Crew Sweater&lt;/a&gt; from American Eagle in Burgundy($40)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flannel from American Eagle in Navy ($35) (not available online)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.madewell.com/madewell_category/DENIMBAR/highriseskinnyjeans/PRDOVR~E0494/E0494.jsp"&gt;Madewell 10&amp;quot; High Rise Skinny Jeans&lt;/a&gt; ($40 on super sale in store!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming in at just under $250, this may have been one of my most
successful shopping trips EVER!  Shopping intentionally, with a
cohesive and functional wardrobe in mind was much more gratifying and
useful than just buying things I liked, or thought other people looked
good in.  In the past I would never have dreamed of a $250 shopping
spree, but now I can pay with confidence knowing I'm buying
(relatively) high quality items that I'll wear again and again, and
that serve my life in ways I need.  I'm still a long way from the
minimal wardrobe I dream of, and I know that some of these purchases
may no doubt turn out to be mistakes. But I'll learn from those, and
continue to create a wardrobe that fits me and my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more,
investing in my closet and clothes that fit &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; was very empowering,
with respect to my body.  Like many American women I've struggled to
have a good relationship with my body ever since puberty.  I've never
had an eating disorder, or done anything extreme, but there are always
days that my confidence is just gone, and I find myself obsessing over
how much better I would look if I was skinnier.  I know, logically,
that this is silly: I'm perfectly healthy, and at a perfectly normal
weight and size.  I should also emphasize that, aside from one
horrible boyfriend who called me 'fat' a few times, this pressure was
always internal.  Many people in my life tell me regularly that I'm
beautiful and sexy, and I don't doubt that they mean it. But &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;
didn't feel beautiful, and that's what counts.  Investing in my
wardrobe is one small step towards loving my body &lt;strong&gt;every damn day&lt;/strong&gt;,
and not letting the episodes of self-conciousness get to me.  I fit in
these clothes now, and I sure as heck don't want to buy new ones!
What's more, I don't want to buy clothes thinking &amp;quot;I'll look so good
in these once I've lost 10 pounds&amp;quot;.  And I didn't. And I will never,
ever do so again. If I do lose weight, then fine, I'll get new clothes
that fit.  But I'm not expecting that, or even hoping for it.  I love
my body now, and want to treat it right by putting things that feel
good on it instead of clothes that squeeze, pull, or pinch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that my wardrobe is set, I hope to not shop for myself until early
December, when I'll get what I need for winter. Until then, I've got
what I need!&lt;/p&gt;

beau and I returning to Seattle for &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bumbershoot.com/"&gt;Bumbershoot&lt;/a&gt; and a little
sight-seeing.  It's a great festival, full of local musicians and amazing
artists, but it is admittedly a little hard to pack for. With everything
from outdoor concerts in the rain, to walking around town, to indoor shows jam-packed with
bralette-clad teenagers, you've got to be ready for all manner of
weather and sweat-levels.  All while avoiding being mistaken for a mom.
So, with four full days ahead of us, here's what I packed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/bumbershoot-packing.png" style="height: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-list"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The List&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 pairs of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/zella-live-in-leggings/3035710"&gt;Black leggings&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/c/zella?origin=productBrandLink"&gt;Zella&lt;/a&gt;.

Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton seem stable.  They're too tight
around my butt and the tops of my thighs, too loose around my waist
and hips, make my legs look like sausages, or &lt;em&gt;constantly&lt;/em&gt; riding
too low.  I pretty much gave up on pants altogether in high school,
and only begrudgingly eased my way back in with leggings during
those too-busy college days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/green-muscle-jeans/2.png" style="height: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT. BUTT. That's all changed. I found a pair that work really well
for my body at a Goodwill, and bought 3 pairs from the retailer
a week later.  &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.ae.com/women-skinny-jean-blue-heaven/web/s-prod/0432_9537_434?cm=sUS-cUSD&amp;amp;catId=cat1990002&amp;amp;N=4294960600,4294960598"&gt;The jeans&lt;/a&gt; are skinny jeans from American Eagle
of all places, and for me (29&amp;quot; waist 42&amp;quot; hips) a size 12 fits
perfectly.  I definitely have to wear them with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/belt.html"&gt;a belt&lt;/a&gt;, but there's
a lot to love about them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They fit my butt and thighs well, providing support without being
too tight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like that they're a little loose around the ankle without being
flared.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They're sturdy but soft, and just a little bit stretchy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
