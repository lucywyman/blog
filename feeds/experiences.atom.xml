better than others.  I decided to get one because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I didn't want to be scared of permanently changing my body.&lt;/strong&gt;  We make
decisions that permanently alter the course of our life pretty often, in much
bigger ways than a tattoo will, and I know I will regret coming to the end
of my life with no permanent marks.  I have scars and birthmarks, it seemed
it was time to make a mark that I got to dictate, that represented some
aspect of myself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's a profoundly human experience&lt;/strong&gt;, and in general I like to experience
things other humans have in order to feel as though I've lived my life to
its fullest.  There are obvious lines I don't cross (ie. heroin), but even
the process of deciding on a design and getting it has taught me a lot.  If
you don't believe me, try it out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wanted to think long and hard about my life up to this point, and find
the parts that mattered the most.&lt;/strong&gt;  Of course, there's no need to get a
tattoo in order to do this.  However, I'm about to graduate from college and
begin The Rest Of My Life,  and for me personally a tattoo seems as good a
way as any to mark this turning point in my life and attempt to encapsulate
the last 21 years into something permanent that I can carry with me going
forward. This isn't to say that I can be boiled down into a single image or
phrase and have that put on my body, but it is to say that there are some
key points to represent symbolically that can help solidify my identity at
this point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They can be beautiful, and start conversations.&lt;/strong&gt; Nuff said.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with these intentions in mind, I set about getting a tattoo. In some ways
it was much easier than expected, in that there is a local tattoo parlor that
does high-quality work and is very safe. But on the whole it wasn't exactly
easy, as permanently changing your body using needles probably shouldn't be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="choosing-a-design"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Choosing a Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted the tattoo to be small, simple, and something I knew I wasn't likely
to regret.  It needed to represent some part of myself that wasn't liable to
change, and that I wouldn't be embarrassed to talk about.  With this criteria
in mind I had a few ideas of things that my tattoo could be &amp;quot;about&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portland, OR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something very generic + symbolic (ie. an equals sign)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was wary of quotes, as they seemed less pliable in their meaning, and seemed
more likely to &amp;quot;tire out&amp;quot; so to speak.  Besides, if I really liked a quote, I
had plenty of skin to get other tattoos in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researching designs brought up a few contenders:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="images/equal-tattoo.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="images/sun-watercolor.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="images/rose-tattoo.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After consulting friends and learning more about what kinds of tattoos are
difficult to execute, and which aren't, I settled on this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="images/my-tattoo.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the portland, in plain black ink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go small at first! You have plenty of space to get bigger ones later,
and you'll know what you're getting yourself into.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get line art.  This limits what you can get quite a bit, but again
line art is so much easier to get, and you'll almost definitely be happier
with the finally product. You can always work your way up to large, colored
tats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go with as few colors as possible.  Colors just add time, complexity,
and money to the tattoo.  It doesn't have to be black and white, but if you
can turn your design into black and white and still love it, it's much
easier!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="getting-the-tattoo"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting the Tattoo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually getting my tattoo was easy and relatively painless. I had a super
brief consultation with the local parlor to get some questions answered and
show them my design, then made an appointment for a few days later.  The only
advice I received about prepping for getting the tattoo was pretty solid life
advice: drink lots of water, eat a good healthy meal before, get enough sleep.
Standard stuff. I got to my appointment &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; early (like, half an hour
early) because I was so nervous, and spent the time filling out some paperwork
and pacing.  My boyfriend came with me, which was very helpful. It was great
not just to have support there, but someone to talk to and experience this
with.  I said it was fine if he didn't come, but in retrospect I would not want
to get a tattoo alone. So, around 7 the tattoo artist set up the table, showed
me her rendering of the design, and then did this cool paper-to-skin thing so
you could basically see how the tattoo was going to look before getting inked.
It looked great, so we got started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My tattoo is on my ribs, which regular tattoo-getters will tell you is among
the more painful spots since it's so close to bone.  It definitely wasn't
comfortable, but my tattoo was so small and simple that it wasn't painful so
much as annoying. It feels like someone is rubbing the tip of a needle on your
skin, not like it's &lt;em&gt;cutting&lt;/em&gt; you, but just lightly scratch.  If you have a
really sharp pencil, you can try drawing on your skin, and that's about how it
feels.  My tattoo took about 10 minutes from start to finish, and with my beau
to keep me distracted it went by pretty quick.  My tattoo artist was also
incredibly sweet, understanding, and supportive, and made the whole experience
that much more pleasant. Once it was done, I took a look to make sure it all
looked good.  I won't get too cheesy, but it was love at first site. As anyone
is with their first tattoo, I was nervous that I would regret getting something
put permanently on my body, but I knew when I saw it that I had made the right
decision. Crisis: avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="images/my-tat-picture.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="post-tattoo"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Post-tattoo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super cool tattoo lady hooked me up with some tattoo-care products for totally
reasonable and worth-it prices, including a nice soap and lotion.  Since my
tattoo was so small and minimal it never hurt, turned red, itched, or any of
the other possible skin irritation that often come after getting a tattoo.  I
even forgot I had one the next day, and as I was getting ready for bed thought
&amp;quot;OH MY GOD WHAT HAPPENED oh right I got a tattoo&amp;quot;.  The lesson: start small!
It's been 100% painless as long as you take good care of it.  It's been exactly
1 week since I got it as of this writing, and by now it feels like a completely
normal and natural part of my body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I'm very happy with my tattoo, and the decision to get it. There are
totally unexpected side effects of empowerment, and my tattoo is not just a
reminder of where I come from but that my body is &lt;em&gt;mine&lt;/em&gt;, and that I get to
choose what happens to it. I have to admit that my parents explicitly didn't
approve of my getting one, and I was really hurt that they wouldn't support me.
I understand that as parents their job is to keep me safe and avoid regrettable
decisions, which a tattoo very well could be. But (as is hopefully evidenced by
this post!) I put a lot of thought and care into getting one, and wish that
they had been more understanding.  Luckily, it's not very visible, so no one
&lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to know.  Even if they do find out (probably through this post), it's my
body! Yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm thrilled that I can carry a piece of my childhood with me into adulthood
now, and know what it's like to be tattooed.  It's almost like being part of a
club, and has already sparked some very interesting and intimate conversations
with co-workers and friends about their tattoos, and how they decided to get
them.  I'm not sure what the best way to end this post is, but I hope it's
been helpful | insightful | interesting! Have an excellent day :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Day 0:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pulled up to the venue at about 5:30 Friday night, T-90 minutes to Ignite
talks.  I chugged a chocolate milk from the &amp;quot;gift store&amp;quot;, ran through my
slides one last time, got dinner with the bosses, and found myself on a stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-ignite-talks"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Ignite Talks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deb Nicholson, &lt;strong&gt;The Foss Awakens&lt;/strong&gt;. How collaboration and mentoring
are a force for good, told with Star Wars images. Grade-A speaker, definitely
delivered. Great way to start the evening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gilbert Standen, &lt;strong&gt;Building Oracle on LXC&lt;/strong&gt;. He lost me at &amp;quot;Oracle&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Me. &lt;strong&gt;Rocking the House&lt;/strong&gt;.  But seriously, people laughed at my jokes,
I got high-fived, it went better than expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dave Nielsen, &lt;strong&gt;Redis&lt;/strong&gt;. Kind of informative, kind of boring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emily Dunham, &lt;strong&gt;Where's the Cloud&lt;/strong&gt;. Much like Deb, Emily is a veteran
speaker and it shows. Funny, informative, ended on a pun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don Marti, &lt;strong&gt;Web ads&lt;/strong&gt;. I would have appreciated it more if I was less sleepy
I think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Justin King, &lt;strong&gt;Choosing a Framework for your project&lt;/strong&gt;. Knowledgable and
well spoken, it's pretty great to watch a not-adult give a talk.  They have
great perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corey Quinn: &lt;strong&gt;Docker Must Die: Heresy in the Church of Docker&lt;/strong&gt;. So, so
funny. Dude is a master.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some good laughs, I headed back up to my room, realized how
overwhelmingly underprepared I was for my talk, finished up my slides and hit
the hay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="day-1"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 1:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woke up early and got breakfast at this adorable bakery, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/euro-pane-bakery-pasadena"&gt;Euro Pane&lt;/a&gt;.
Ran through the talk once for good measure, then headed over to the Key Note,
by Mark Shuttleworth. Honestly, it was pretty much a sales pitch, and I
wasn't really into it. But at least I didn't feel bad leaving early. I headed
over to my room, set everything up, then walked around to get out the nerves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="my-talk"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My Talk&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://slides.lucywyman.me/modifying-the-kernel.html"&gt;Modifying the Kernel: A How-to&lt;/a&gt;
Not my best, not my worst. I got across the information I wanted to, and got
lots of positive feedback after the talk and throughout the day. More than
anything, I'm relieved that it's over and I can cross it off of my
to-do list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="lunch"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lunch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had guacamole, made tableside. It was &lt;em&gt;bomb&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="keila-banks-automated-teen"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keila Banks, Automated Teen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was really excited for this talk, and was a little let down. Between mic
issues, some nerves, and being a little out of touch with the conference,
I didn't get what I wanted to out of the talk.  All of that said, I have a
lot of respect for Keila giving a talk to such a big room, and for getting up
there in the first place. I'm excited to see what she does in the future, and
hope to see her at other Open Source conferences soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="justin-mayer-essential-linux-security"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Justin Mayer, Essential Linux Security&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was pretty nearly the perfect talk.  I learned about a lot of valuable
tools, including changes you can make to your SSH configs, creating SSL
certificates with Let's Encrypt, HSTS, CSP, and other tools to make my
computer and websites safer.  In Justin's words, &amp;quot;Think of the children&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check out his slides at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://justinmayer.com/talks/server-security/#/"&gt;https://justinmayer.com/talks/server-security/#/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="brandon-philips-etcd"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Brandon Philips, Etcd&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also a great talk. Brandon is obviously a well-practiced speaker who
seemed very comfortable on stage.  He's also incredibly knowledgeable, and it
was clear that this talk was only skimming the surface of what he knows on
the subject of etcd. I also didn't know very much about etcd or CoreOS going
in to the talk -- I even thought the d was for daemon :p -- so stood to get
a lot out of it. And I did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see some of the demos he did at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/philips/hacks/tree/master/etcd-demos"&gt;https://github.com/philips/hacks/tree/master/etcd-demos&lt;/a&gt;,
or learn more about CoreOS at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://coreos.com/"&gt;https://coreos.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="day-2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 2:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning was absolutely &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt; in Pasadena.  I got to walk around
for a while before everyone else woke up, and soak in some Sunday Morning
magic. I don't know. There's something about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="keynote-sarah-sharp-on-diversity"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keynote: Sarah Sharp on Diversity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said a lot of really important things, but they're also things that everyone
has heard before.  She knows her stuff, and seems very passionate, but that
keynote isn't going to change anything.  Call me a cynic, but from the two
guys behind me asking &amp;quot;Why should minorities get a stipend just for getting an
internship?&amp;quot; to ethnic homogeneity of the audience, I don't hold much hope
for tech companies realizing how important diversity of their workforce is
any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="randal-schwartz-intro-to-dart"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Randal Schwartz, Intro to Dart&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I spent this whole talk just working on making this blog. Woops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="other-things-i-saw-today"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other Things I Saw Today&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two pugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three grown men yell group hug and execute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the rest of the day doing homework and travelling. It's amazing how
much effort it takes to move a human from A to B, and I have to say I was
so exhausted by the time we got to Corvallis around 12:30.  Lesson learned:
I am not a Sunday-worker. Sundays are for blankets and tea and tv, not
late night flights and talking to other humans.  Overall, SCaLE was
less stressful than I thought it would be, and I don't regret going
like I thought I would. Maybe that sounds lukewarm, and I have to say
it is a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; well run conference, and my particular sentiments don't
reflect a lack of effort on the part of the organizers,
presenters, or exhibitors. Objectively, it's a great conference.  I'm
not really sure how to end this post. I might think of something
better later. For now, ciao gentle reader. You excellent human you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
