OR. I've been travelling to Portland for work pretty frequently since
moving to Seattle, and among the things I love about visiting Portland
is getting to buy food on the company's dime (or having my parents pay
for my food if we go out). This trip is for pleasure though, and while
my partner and I are typically very diligent about planning our food,
bringing snacks, grocery shopping and making out own food even on
vacation I completely neglected to do that for this particular trip. I
found myself away from home with no food and no one paying my way, and
have therefore eaten out for every meal. And it has been equal parts
&lt;em&gt;expensive&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;delightful&lt;/em&gt;. I'm much more aware and concious of my
purchases since they are with my own money, and find myself
introspecting deeply before each meal. &lt;em&gt;Is this what I want to eat? Is
it worth the price? How hungry am I really? What am I craving?&lt;/em&gt; And I
also find myself enjoying my meals much more. At home, eating is often
pleasurable but also something I kind of have to do. I won't say it's
&amp;quot;something to get through&amp;quot; -- I love to eat -- but it's not something
I reflect on much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also realized that part of my relishing these meals out is that
&lt;em&gt;I didn't have to do anything&lt;/em&gt; (except pay, woops). I didn't have to
get the groceries, or slice the veggies, or cook the food, or do the
dishes. I didn't have to save the leftovers or take out the trash or
wipe the counters.  This realization makes it sound like I've never
eaten out before, which of course I have innumerable times. And in
general I'd say I don't even like eating out that much - I love to
cook, and to know what I'm going to eat ahead of time, and besides am
generally a very picky eater. But on this trip, not having to think
about food and eating what I want when I want without any of the work
has been &lt;em&gt;divine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think what I'm realizing in this moment more than how fun it is to
eat out is how nice it is to be taken care of. In this case the
eateries are taking care of me, but I also love seeing my parents for
this reason: I feel taken care of. I feel free of worry and
responsibility, neither of which weigh particularly heavy on me at all
but enough that I appreciate when they aren't there. That's something
I didn't, and couldn't, appreciate as a kid, when everything was taken
care of. And begs the question &lt;em&gt;what do I have now that I'm not
appreciating before it's gone?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyway, major shout out to my mom for taking care of me, both as a
kid and now. Both literally and figuratively, I couldn't have done it
without you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.glamour.com/gallery/post-weinstein-these-are-the-powerful-men-facing-sexual-harassment-allegations"&gt;innumerable&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.glamour.com/story/women-accuse-louis-ck-of-sexual-misconduct-and-improper-advances"&gt;allegations&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://variety.com/2017/biz/news/matt-lauer-accused-sexual-harassment-multiple-women-1202625959/"&gt;sexual&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/garrison-keillor-says-fired-over-alleged-improper-behavior/2017/11/29/433fc97a-d52a-11e7-9ad9-ca0619edfa05_story.html?utm_term=.af00b3400d77"&gt;harassment&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/woman-says-roy-moore-initiated-sexual-encounter-when-she-was-14-he-was-32/2017/11/09/1f495878-c293-11e7-afe9-4f60b5a6c4a0_story.html?utm_term=.a680c19dc8f1"&gt;assault&lt;/a&gt; come
to light, our first instinct is to mourn the loss of the people we thought we
knew and loved. Though we always knew, somewhere, that their personas were a
well-crafted act they &lt;em&gt;felt&lt;/em&gt; so genuine and real. We thought we &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; Matt
Lauer, or Louis CK, or Charlie Rose, and losing our perception of these artists
is, in it's way, a kind of death in the family. &amp;quot;No, don't take Savannah from
me too!&amp;quot; my mom cries, hearing rumors that Savannah had an affair with Lauer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I don't understand this. Each time the gross sexual misconduct of a
celebrity is brought to light, the women in my life act as if something
has been lost, because for them it has been. But they always fail to
acknowledge the incredible gain that these stories have: &lt;strong&gt;that we will live in
a safer, more just world&lt;/strong&gt;. Their daughters won't have to spread their legs to
get the starring role, or ignore come-ons and grabs at an office party as if
they aren't happening. Their sisters won't live in fear of being alone in a
room with their boss, or have the powerful take advantage of them. And if they
do experience any of that? They can tell someone, and know &lt;em&gt;someone will listen
and care&lt;/em&gt;. They'll know that it isn't OK, that this isn't the world we want to
live in, and that their perpetrator will be brought to justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not advocating we give up our love of celebrity and fame here (though I do
think considering it's magnitude and taking a step back could benefit
everyone). You can still love an artist's work, and condemn the actions of the
artist. But I want the women in my life to stop letting nostalgia and &amp;quot;it's how
we were raised&amp;quot; cloud their responses to these allegations. I want us to
acknowledge how incredible it is that stories are not just being told, but
&lt;em&gt;heard&lt;/em&gt; and acted upon. &lt;strong&gt;It's OK to mourn the loss of artists we love, but we
also need to add &amp;quot;How disgusting. I'm so glad that she spoke up.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;. We need to
celebrate that even the most powerful among us must face consequences for
hurting others, and that our culture is shifting to empower victims of sexual
harassment and assault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you reminisce about Kevin Spacey, or Al Franken, what I hear you saying is
&amp;quot;Their career is more important than hers anyway. If that happened to someone I
knew, I hope she'd reason about whether it was really worth it to destroy a
person's career and future just because she was uncomfortable&amp;quot;. I know, that's
not what you mean. But it's what you're saying. And it sucks knowing that
that's what the people I love think. I hope we can do better.&lt;/p&gt;
