lot for the past month - a blessing and a curse - which has meant I
get to see a lot of wonderful humans I care for and don't see very
often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've unknowingly been on a books-by-women-about-women kick
this summer - I didn't even notice until scrolling through my library
history. And honestly I'm really into it. This has been a pretty good
run of high-quality reads, most of them the right balance of fun and
meaningful. I've talked before about &amp;quot;vegetable books&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;candy
books&amp;quot;, but I think many of these reads can probably be called &amp;quot;fruit
books&amp;quot;: sweet, and secretly good for you. And often brightly colored
on the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="when-katie-met-cassidy"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31684565-when-katie-met-cassidy"&gt;When Katie Met Cassidy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Camille Perri&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/when-katie-met-cassidy.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I fell in love with both of the heroines in this book. They're
such rich, complex, layered characters I felt like I knew them in real
life. Camille Perri is a master at describing emotional responses,
details in interactions, and wardrobes, in a way that paints such a
complete picture of Katie and Cassidy's relationship. I loved how she
bent gendered stereotypes so effortlessly: of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; Katie was going
to fall for Cassidy, of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; they were meant to be together. A
fantastic modern love story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it possible for there to be a hilarious book about cancer? Well, if
it is, I can't imagine it gets better than &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36373380-the-bucket-list"&gt;The Bucket List&lt;/a&gt;. The
protagonist is a sarcastic young woman who so closely mirrors my own
struggle with balancing work and feminism and life and womanhood it's
like reading my diary. What I love about this book is the voice and
style of the character, the way she's not just contending with having
the BRCA 1 gene mutation but also &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt; as a 20-something in New
York. Highly, highly recommended reading for the right mix of fun and
thought-provoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know everyone is already buzzing about &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15749186-to-all-the-boys-i-ve-loved-before"&gt;To All the Boys I've Loved
Before&lt;/a&gt; since Netflix made it &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80203147"&gt;a movie&lt;/a&gt;, but I'm here to throw in
another &amp;quot;You should read this!&amp;quot;.  It's more YA than fiction or
romance, but is so sweet and (for a 23 year old like me) nostalgic.
It's a wonderful teenage romance, with all the angst and drama and
heightened emotions you'd expect but without the jerky boys and
vampires. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.gq.com/story/horny-for-wholesome"&gt;This GQ article&lt;/a&gt; sums it up: &amp;quot;At last, with the help of
Netflix, we have our new type: the wholesome man.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="meet-the-frugalwoods"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elizabeth Willard Thames&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/meet-the-frugalwoods.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know anything about the &lt;a class="reference internal" href="#financial-independence-retire-early-fire"&gt;financial independence / retire early
(FIRE)&lt;/a&gt; community, it's probably &lt;a class="reference internal" href="#mr-money-mustache"&gt;Mr. Money Mustache&lt;/a&gt;. And if you
read MMM, you're probably either 1. A bro who identifies strongly with
him and who loves to brag to your friends about how you haven't eaten at a
restaurant for 3 years or 2. A normal person who was intimidated away
from the notion of saving for retirement. But it doesn't have to be
this way! &lt;a class="reference internal" href="#frugalwoods"&gt;Frugalwoods&lt;/a&gt; is a fantastic FIRE blog written by the
eloquent and sensible Elizabeth Willard Thames, where she prescribes a
more balanced and kind approach to frugality. I love that Elizabeth
acknowledges the privilege inherent in elective frugality, that she
preaches spending based on your &lt;em&gt;values&lt;/em&gt; not on miserly living, and
that she is never judgemental or condescending. I love her blog, and
her book is really just a consolidated and long version of that. I
highly highly highly recommend either, whichever suits your fancy, no
matter where your finances are or what your goals are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="eat-pray-love"&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/eat-pray-love.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reread for the third or fourth time, Elizabeth Gilbert's writing is my
comfort food. Her writing style is so warm and expressive, filled with
delicious metaphors and rich descriptions. It's like seeing the world
with entirely new eyes, and inspires me to look closer at myself and
my environment. I love all her memoirish books - &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6728738-committed"&gt;Committed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24453082-big-magic"&gt;Big
Magic&lt;/a&gt; are equally wonderful and revelatory - and love coming back to
them at different points throughout my life. A book is never the same
when you come back to it, and each time I notice a new passage or
insight that I somehow missed the first 4 times through. Rather than
recommending you read EPL, though, I recommend picking up a favorite
read from a few years ago. What book do you keep coming back to, or
take comfort in reading?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-fall-of-marigolds"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18114142-a-fall-of-marigolds"&gt;A Fall of Marigolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/a-fall-of-marigolds.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be honest, this book didn't resonate with me that much. I found
one of the main characters - who narrates most of the book - to be
wishy-washy and limp. I didn't like her, though perhaps I wasn't
supposed to like her? Regardless the book was at least good enough to
finish, seemed to resonate with many other people, and while I didn't
&lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; the characters it was well-written and clever. If you like
historical fiction, or stories set in New York, this is for you!&lt;/p&gt;

myself wishing for the coziness of flannels and hot drinks, excited to
bake all things apple and pumpkin flavored, and am already planning my
halloween costume. Here's what I'm excited to do this season!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☐ Get a pumpkin from a pumpkin patch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☑ Take a class - in the spirit of back-to-school&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☐ Send cards to family and friends for Thanksgiving&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;☐ Visit one of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.elysianbrewing.com/locations"&gt;Elysian's&lt;/a&gt; breweries for some &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.elysianbrewing.com/beer?beer=174"&gt;pumpkin stout&lt;/a&gt; - maybe even attend the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.elysianbrewing.com/elysian-brewing-events/14th-annual-great-pumpkin-beer-festival/"&gt;Great Pumpkin Beer Festival&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☐ Visit Pike's Place Market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☐ Bake cinnamon rolls&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☐ Dress up for Halloween - I'm thinking of going as Hermione Granger this year&lt;/p&gt;

still in the dog days of summer, soaking in the sunshine and trying to
ignore the back-to-school ads even though we're not technically on
summer break anymore. My summer has been busy in the best possible
way, and I feel like I've made the most of every moment. There've been
barbecues, berry-picking, hikes, a wedding, movies, ice cream,
farmers markets, and of course so much time with friends and family.
And books! Here's what I've been enjoying lately:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-curious-charms-of-arthur-pepper"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26722820-the-curious-charms-of-arthur-pepper"&gt;The Curious Charms of Arthur Pepper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phaedra Patrick&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/charms-of-arthur-pepper.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the sweetest book! With great character development and a
charming story, this book surprised me with it's depth of plot and mix
of eccentric and realistic events. It handled real issues of aging,
life after the loss of a loved one, and finding meaning in life, while
also including a scene about a man who only wear electric blue and
owns several tigers. Definitely the feel-good story of the summer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="when-life-gives-you-lululemons"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36373647-when-life-gives-you-lululemons"&gt;When Life Gives You Lululemons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lauren Weisberger&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/life-gives-you-lululemons.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know &lt;em&gt;The Devil Wears Prada&lt;/em&gt; is a series?? Me neither. This is
the third installment, which I didn't even realize until I looked at
the goodreads page after finishing it. You definitely don't need to
have read the 2nd one to understand this one, and if you like DWP you
will love &lt;em&gt;When Life Gives You Lululemons&lt;/em&gt;! It's funny, relatable,
heartbreaking, and in the end victorious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="save-the-date"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="#save-the-date"&gt;Save the Date&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mary Kay Andrews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/save-the-date.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cute enough romance story. I'm honestly not a huge fan of the
love-to-hate trope, but did love that the female lead was a business
owner and in the end grew to like both characters. Not my first
recommendation, but a quick candy read if your romance novel TBR list
has dried up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-handmaid-s-tale"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="#the-handmaid-s-tale"&gt;The Handmaid's Tale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Margaret Atwood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/handmaids-tale.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be honest: I really didn't like this book. But I still think you
should read it. Since I can't handle watching the show, reading the
book is the next best way to be able to talk to other people about
the story and to understand the nuances of how it's used in everyday
conversation. This book is definitely part of our modern zeitgeist,
and as painful as oflgen's lack of character development and action
is, and as painful as Atwood's over-the-top grandiose writing style
is, there's a lot to unpack and discuss. Get through it, then be like
me and tell everyone all the things you didn't like about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

OR. I've been travelling to Portland for work pretty frequently since
moving to Seattle, and among the things I love about visiting Portland
is getting to buy food on the company's dime (or having my parents pay
for my food if we go out). This trip is for pleasure though, and while
my partner and I are typically very diligent about planning our food,
bringing snacks, grocery shopping and making out own food even on
vacation I completely neglected to do that for this particular trip. I
found myself away from home with no food and no one paying my way, and
have therefore eaten out for every meal. And it has been equal parts
&lt;em&gt;expensive&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;delightful&lt;/em&gt;. I'm much more aware and concious of my
purchases since they are with my own money, and find myself
introspecting deeply before each meal. &lt;em&gt;Is this what I want to eat? Is
it worth the price? How hungry am I really? What am I craving?&lt;/em&gt; And I
also find myself enjoying my meals much more. At home, eating is often
pleasurable but also something I kind of have to do. I won't say it's
&amp;quot;something to get through&amp;quot; -- I love to eat -- but it's not something
I reflect on much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also realized that part of my relishing these meals out is that
&lt;em&gt;I didn't have to do anything&lt;/em&gt; (except pay, woops). I didn't have to
get the groceries, or slice the veggies, or cook the food, or do the
dishes. I didn't have to save the leftovers or take out the trash or
wipe the counters.  This realization makes it sound like I've never
eaten out before, which of course I have innumerable times. And in
general I'd say I don't even like eating out that much - I love to
cook, and to know what I'm going to eat ahead of time, and besides am
generally a very picky eater. But on this trip, not having to think
about food and eating what I want when I want without any of the work
has been &lt;em&gt;divine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think what I'm realizing in this moment more than how fun it is to
eat out is how nice it is to be taken care of. In this case the
eateries are taking care of me, but I also love seeing my parents for
this reason: I feel taken care of. I feel free of worry and
responsibility, neither of which weigh particularly heavy on me at all
but enough that I appreciate when they aren't there. That's something
I didn't, and couldn't, appreciate as a kid, when everything was taken
care of. And begs the question &lt;em&gt;what do I have now that I'm not
appreciating before it's gone?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyway, major shout out to my mom for taking care of me, both as a
kid and now. Both literally and figuratively, I couldn't have done it
without you.&lt;/p&gt;

a stand out. A combination of career advancement (read: getting
smarter), gaining experience, and having a number of contacts old and
new at the conference made it a particularly great experience. I've
gotten to the point where I'm better at choosing talks that are
relevant to my field, and I have context to learn from them but don't
know enough to get nothing from them. This is all a long way of saying
that I have a lot of meaningful takeaways from this conf and can start
applying to my work immediately, as well as a lot of great experiences
reconnecting with old friends and solidifying my relationship with new
ones!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Videos won't be available for 3-4 weeks, but when they are I
highly recommend:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or/public/schedule/detail/67766"&gt;Building Your Own Cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt; for understanding how fiat

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a play-by-play rundown of the last 2 days:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suz Hinton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk was so inspiring! Once I started working I stopped playing
with technology as much, and trying new things just for the fun of it.
So what if I'm not building something useful? What if we just built
things for fun, to learn? I used to do this often on the weekends
during university, and feel I've lost that sense of adventure and
curiosity since I started working. I have a dusty arduino at the house
that I've been uninspired to build something with. This talk inspired
me to just start &lt;em&gt;playing&lt;/em&gt; with it, and not worry about if it was
useful in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Camille Eddy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm embarrassed to admit I've never considered that AI would inherit
our human biases, or how that would impact marginalized groups. Eddy
told the story of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.media.mit.edu/people/joyab/overview/"&gt;MIT researcher Joy Buolamwini&lt;/a&gt;, who wasn't
recognized by the facial recognition AI she was developing until she
wore a white mask, to demonstrate how our own biases and inequalities
translate to the tools we develop. This talk reenergized me to
continue working toward a more diverse tech industry, and to continue
advocating for diversity and inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="open-source-and-open-standards-in-the-age-of-cloud-ai"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or/public/schedule/detail/70444"&gt;Open source and open standards in the age of cloud AI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tim O'Reilly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'Reilly reaffirmed and expanded on Eddy's talk, discussing how
algorithms and AI impact who gets what and why. It was really about
how open standards, open data, and community are the backbone of
successful technology, and how new technical industries like AI and
cloud computing will need to embrace and serve their communities
rather than shut them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="introduction-to-blockchains"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or/public/schedule/detail/67153"&gt;Introduction to Blockchains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By ME&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my talk! I won the scheduling lottery being assigned the
first timeslot on the first day. The room was packed with people, and
everyone was engaged and excited to learn about cool math! I'll be
totally honest: most of the time when I finish a talk I pick it apart
and dwell on what I could have done better. While this talk definitely
wasn't &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt;, I'm genuinely really proud of my delivery. I can
tell my public speaking style is improving and that practicing this
talk early and often paid off. I felt very in control of the
talk and the audience, and capable of answering any questions. All in
all, a talk I'm excited to give again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="mary-had-a-little-lambda"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or/public/schedule/detail/67384"&gt;Mary Had a Little Lambda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anjana Vakil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I knew too much going into this talk. I know I just wrote
about how I'm getting better at choosing talks, and that's because
this is the only talk I felt overqualified for. A review of lambda
functions it turns out I didn't need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tl-dr-nist-container-security-standards"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or/public/schedule/detail/67276"&gt;TL;DR: NIST Container Security Standards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elsie Philips and Paul Burt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brief overview of the NIST container security standards, or how to
keep your containers secure. I'll admit I didn't get much new
information from this talk, but it was great to see a friend from
university and some entertaining memes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="building-your-own-cryptocurrency"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or/public/schedule/detail/67766"&gt;Building Your Own Cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;John Feminella&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk was &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;. Feminella talked about how &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; currency
(dollars and euros) work, and what features of those currencies
cryptocurrencies will need to have in order to succeed. I'd consider
myself financially literate in a practical sense, but I never learned
about fiat currency or thought about what gives money value. It's
always been an &amp;quot;it just is&amp;quot; kind of thing for me. It was awesome to
step back and think about money as having features, and what those
features might look like for cryptos. I don't invest very much in
cryptos, but it was also a very sobering reality check amongst a lot
of hype. Highly recommend giving this a watch if you're interested in
how money works or how viable cryptos are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roger Magoulas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting dive into search term data on the O'Reilly website (I
think Safari specifically). I don't think there were any great
surprises:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python, Java, and Javascript are the most popular languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes, Go, and Blockchain are gaining popularity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rust has stagnated, at least in number of people searching for it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All interesting affirmations in data of things we already knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or/public/schedule/detail/66678"&gt;Coding a Blockchain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Josh Butikofer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the tracks this year was 'Live Coding', and I was admittedly
skeptical going in. I wasn't sure how interesting it would be to watch
someone code, or how deep you could go writing code in 40 minutes. It
turns out it's an &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt; format (also Josh is super good at it!).
Live coding was a perfect middle ground between reading code (which
results in little absorption of the material) and trying to write code
yourself (which requires a much bigger time investment and can be
confusing and frustrating). Having a relative expert walk you through
what they were writing, why, and then &lt;em&gt;seeing it in code&lt;/em&gt; was super
helpful for solidifying my understanding of blockchains. While this
talk was a direct subset of topics I covered in my own talk, I found
watching someone write it live valuable. Highly recommend this talk as
well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="istio-weaving-securing-and-observing-your-microservices"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daniel Berg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first heard about Istio at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-portland/welcome/"&gt;DevOps Days PDX&lt;/a&gt; last year, and didn't
understand it at all. While I've had it explained a few times since,
this talk was a real 'Aha' moment for me. Berg clearly explains, with
great visuals and simple language, what Istio is, what it can be used
for, and gives us a tour of it's features. As a member of the devops
community (if not a devops engineer) it will be so helpful to have a
basic understanding of Istio going forward. Not the most riveting
talk, but definitely one I got a lot out of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="grpc-vs-rest"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or/public/schedule/detail/66328"&gt;GRPC vs. REST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alex Borysov and Mykyta Protsenko&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibly the most entertaining talk of OSCON 2018, this talk discussed
the differences between REST and gRPC for API construction. I learned
that gRPC is an actual library as opposed to an architectural pattern,
and that it's ideal for performant, asynchronous APIs. A great
deep-dive that I'd like to re-watch once it's out, as in-person I was
pretty mentally exhausted by that point :)&lt;/p&gt;

have found myself reading one great book after another! Great might
actually be a bit of a strong word for these books -- maybe fun is
more appropriate? Regardless, these books are ~perfect~ for the
upcoming summer months, with it's beach trips, long drives, airplane
rides, and lazy Sundays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-dry"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Dry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jane Harper&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the book all your Liane-Moriarty-fan friends are going to be
talking about this summer. Set in a rural Australian town, a father,
mother, and son are found dead on their farm leaving only their baby
daughter alive. Initially suspected to be a murder-suicide by the
father figure,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="when-rishi-met-dimple"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;cite&gt;When Rishi Met Dimple&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sandhya Menon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a tremendously enjoyable YA novel; candy read to the max. I
loved both protagonists, and appreciated what layered and well-rounded
characters they were. Their 'issues' felt very realistic, and the
events of the book didn't feel as contrived as romance and especially
YA romance can often feel. I also of course loved the technical
setting of the book, and a strong female lead. Highly recommended easy
reading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pachinko"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Pachinko&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Min Jin Lee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read this for a book club, and since there were approximately 1
million holds on the audio book and e-book at the Library, I ended up
picking up the physical hard-cover copy of it. This is the first
physical book I've read at least since college, probably since high
school, and I'll admit I was a little worried I had forgotten how to
read physical books. But not so! I surprised myself by reading this
600 page book in just 5 days, and was &lt;em&gt;riveted&lt;/em&gt;. I didn't expect I
would like the book itself, much less in book-form, but found myself
reading it every chance I got. I loved the focus on characters and not
events, the way that despite triumphs and tragedies life continues to
go on, and the way we see social changes reflected in the characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-royal-we"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Royal We&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heather Cocks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another candy read 🙃  but that's what summer is for, right?? I loved
this royal wedding fan-fic, and while the royal wedding has passed us
by (cries) we can still read about royal wedding drama right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-sisterhood-of-the-travelling-pants"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ann Brashares&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A classic! I re-read this recently (in one day, no less) to celebrate
the arrival of summer, and was surprised by how well it stood the test
of time and aging.  Perhaps part of my love is for the nostalgia of
reading it when I was growing up, but I fell right back in love with
the 4 heroines and their friendship. We don't write about female
friendship enough, and these ladies are truly inspiring! More like
this please thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

was in black and white for the last few months and now we're in Oz.
I'm so excited for my first summer in Seattle, and can't wait to see
what adventures await us in the coming months! Ok, enough sun-crazed
excitement for now, let's peek at what we'll be up to this year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☑  Go on a 5 mile hike&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☑  Go berry picking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☑  Ride the Seattle Ferris Wheel (We didn't technically do this
because we got there and realized it was $14 per person to ride, which
we just couldn't stomach. But I'm giving us credit for going out
there).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☑  Make s'mores&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☑  Host a barbecue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☑  Go to Shakespeare in the park OR a movie in the park&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☑  Go to a trivia night at a local bar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☑  Bake &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; (hopefully &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.acozykitchen.com/gluten-free-strawberry-tart/"&gt;this strawberry tart&lt;/a&gt;) (ended up
being this &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://recipes.lucywyman.me/chocolate-banana-bread.html"&gt;banana bread&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many food related things! Hopefully berry-picking and
strawberry-tart-making can happen back-to-back ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kingcounty.gov/depts/transportation/metro/fares-orca/orca-cards.aspx"&gt;Orca card&lt;/a&gt;) attached to my phone, so keeping the WeWork card there
was a no-go. Keeping it in my wallet is also an option, but I don't
typically carry my wallet with me around the office, especially since
I have a limited number of outfits that have pockets. The ideal
solution for my RFID card woes would be something I could wear on my
body, that didn't need to be carried and could easily be passed by the
readers while I was juggling a water bottle and laptop. Something
like...a bracelet! So I set out to copy my WeWork RFID onto an RFID
bracelet. Long story short: I failed, I think because the super-cheap
RFID reader/writer I bought was &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; cheap. But I wanted to blog
about it anyway in an effort to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://time.com/3206754/publication-bias-null-results/"&gt;write about my failures as well as my
successes&lt;/a&gt;. For science!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-windows-vm"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Windows VM&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started out by purchasing the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/125KHZ-Reader-Writer-Duplicator-Control/dp/B079HVQXQY/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1526008775&amp;amp;sr=8-4&amp;amp;keywords=rfid+writer#customerReviews"&gt;RFID reader/writer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/YARONGTECH-13-56MHZ-ISO14443A-Silicone-wristband/dp/B01FR63GVG/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1526008799&amp;amp;sr=8-5&amp;amp;keywords=rfid+bracelet#customerReviews"&gt;RFID Bracelets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending about an hour researching Linux utilities for RFID
readers/writers, I decided I should just use the software on the CD
that came with the copier. It was a .exe of course, so the first order
of business was spinning up a windows VM on my machine. The first snag
I hit was that the CD could only be installed on 32-bit Windows, not
64-bit, so after getting my 64-bit &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://aka.ms/ie11.win81.vagrant"&gt;Windows 8.1 VM&lt;/a&gt; setup I had to
tear it down and find a vagrant box for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://app.vagrantup.com/mrh1997/boxes/vanilla-win7-32bit"&gt;32-bit Windows&lt;/a&gt;. 'Snag'
might be a strong word there, it was mostly just annoying and time
consuming. This is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/lucywyman/373c7a4352bb207bc41d57eb774e66fe"&gt;the Vagrantfile&lt;/a&gt; I ended up using. Important to
note that in addition to the particular Windows VM, I also needed to
mount the copier device to the VM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-copier"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Copier&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the software installed, and the correct device mounted so I could
connect the copier to the Windows VM, it was time to copy RFIDs! Or so
I thought. The copier beeped when I plugged it in, and successfully
connected to the GUI. Yay! I put my WeWork card on it and clicked
'Read'. It turned red and made angry beeping noises. Boo. I collected
a few other RFIDs I had around the house -- my Orca card, the badge
from our Portland office, my passport -- and tried those as well, all
without success. Maybe I was doing it wrong? The copier came with some
blank RFID tags, so I put one on the copier and wrote random data to
it. It beeped successfully and turned green. Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's really all there was to it. My copier seemed to be working, but
didn't have the right frequencies for the things I actually needed to
read. Forgetting / losing my WeWork card continues to be a problem, so
stayed tuned for other attempts at the bracelet solution or other
creative solutions to the problem!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

fruit. Dessert is my favorite meal, and sugar is my love language. I
don't tend to eat sweets very often because they aren't so good for
you in large and frequent doses, but when I do indulge it can be a
transcendental experience. I can trace my life through memorable
desserts, whether it's going to New Seasons late at night with my mom
to split a slice of Bavarian Cream Banana Cake or the cold
strawberry soup I had on a cruise ship 12 years ago. Like how many
people associate smells with memories, these desserts remind of me of
where I was when I had them and of how I felt at the time. Each one
has a story, and the decadence of the dessert along with the nostalgia
of the story makes these sweet treats special.&lt;/p&gt;

thank you very much. While the cacao drinking chocolate doesn't come
with whipped cream it is &lt;em&gt;absolutely nothing like hot chocolate&lt;/em&gt;. It's
like how monkeys and humans share ninety-whatever percent of their
DNA: they are so similar and yet one &lt;em&gt;invented computers&lt;/em&gt; while the
other throws poop. The only bad part about the drinking chocolate is
that you can never drink hot chocolate again without being a little
disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pot-de-creme"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ringsidefishhouse.com/"&gt;Pot de Creme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the day I had this: it was August 26th of 2017. We had
spent the day at the Oregon State Fair for my mom's birthday, an
annual family tradition, and were hosting my parent's friend Bill from
out of town. We decided to go to a nice place for dinner to celebrate,
and after &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; research found ourselves at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ringsidefishhouse.com/"&gt;Ringside Fish
House&lt;/a&gt; in downtown Portland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom and I both ordered the 'Theater 3-course Special' (highly
recommend), because despite a pot de creme not being the dessert we
would choose the rest of the meal was just what we wanted, and at a
great price (I had my eye on the Spice Almond Orange Cake for dessert,
but a pot de creme would do). The meal was excellent, but we didn't
have high expectations for the desserts we had settled for. When the
Milk Chocolate Pot de Creme (the current menu states it's a Malted
Vanilla, but I know ours were Milk Chocolate) arrived, we dug in. And
then we died and went to heaven. This Pot de Creme was silky, rich,
the perfect texture and flavor. Perhaps it was because we weren't
expecting it, or perhaps it's because Ringside uses actual unicorn
hair in their desserts. But it was unquestionably the best dessert
I've ever had. And lucky for me, if there's anyone who appreciates a
great dessert like I do, it's my mom. We reveled in the experience,
passing our bowls around for others to try, and bringing the
conversation to a jolting halt for the rest of the meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't been back since, and cannot vouch for the Vanilla Malt
flavor (yet). But if you're looking for something otherworldly, this
is your place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="new-seasons-bavarian-cream-banana-cake"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.copymethat.com/r/cKPakSW/new-seasons-banana-bavarian-cake/"&gt;New Seasons Bavarian Cream Banana Cake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm fuzzy on when this memory is from, but I remember as a teenager
driving to the New Seasons in Sellwood late at night with my mom just
to share this Bavarian Cream Banana Cake. I'll admit I'm usually more
of a chocolate-dessert person than a fruit-dessert person (as you can
tell by this list), but this cake is &lt;em&gt;divine&lt;/em&gt;. It's light and fluffy,
spongy, and overwhelmed with thick whipped cream. This cake reminds me
that there are days that are really rough, that you get to the end of
and don't want but need something to turn it around. It's a reminder
that it's ok to indulge late at night, to want something sweet and
cloud-like, to call ahead and make sure they still have some. Though
not &amp;quot;decadent&amp;quot; this cake represents indulgence to me, and being kind
to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="sky-high-salted-panorama-porter-brownie"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://skyhighbrewing.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Food-Menu-5.24.17.pdf"&gt;Sky High Salted Panorama Porter Brownie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering this is the only thing on the dessert menu at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://skyhighbrewing.com/"&gt;Sky High
Brewing&lt;/a&gt;, you wouldn't expect it to be that great. A dessert to
satiate your wailing toddler, or keep you awake later in the night.
But this brownie is out of this world. It's huge, warm, and deeply
chocolatey. It's fudgy and thick, the kind that sticks to the roof of
your mouth, and is just as salty as it is sweet. For when you want --
no, need -- something deeply chocolate to cure what ails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shared this with a friend the day after a particularly bad day. I
don't remember what had gone wrong, but I'm assuming it had something
to do with a boy or a particularly stressful test. Whatever it was, I
was in tears and my friend said &amp;quot;Let's talk about it over a brownie&amp;quot;.
While the talking obviously helped more than the brownie, this brownie
was exactly what I needed at that moment: something filling and rich,
thick and full of life. I'll always remember the kindness my friend
showed me that day, and know where to take someone when they've had a
bad day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="interzone-honey-cardamom-latte"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interzone Honey Cardamom Latte&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We met freshman year in the Honors College Dorm, hanging out in the
same common-area studying for classes. Liz was also a lady in
engineering, and we quickly discovered we had common interests and
common friends. After moving out of the dorms it became harder and
harder to make time to hang out, though, so we started scheduling
coffee dates at the local coffee shop Interzone to discuss books,
jobs, hikes, and just catch up. I definitely remember the creamy,
sweet, spicy drink, but more than that remember lovely conversations
with my sweet and spicy friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="sprinkles-cupcakes"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://sprinkles.com"&gt;Sprinkles Cupcakes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sprinkles.com/locations/california/the-grove-los-angeles"&gt;The Grove&lt;/a&gt;, obviously. Sprinkles Cupcakes are oversized
but perfectly proportioned combinations of thick, sweet icing and
moist, soft cake (though the mini sized ones are &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt;). I first
heard of Sprinkles watching the legendary show &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/cupcake-wars"&gt;Cupcake Wars&lt;/a&gt;, where
Sprinkles founder Candice Nelson (I didn't even need to google her
name) was a judge. I was skeptical that any cupcake could really be so
special -- typically they were too sweet even for my taste, and had
either too much or not enough icing. When we first visited Sprinkles
on a trip to LA I realized how wrong I was. It was a revelation. I
remember my mom and I sitting by the dancing fountain, closing our
eyes and savoring the delicious cakes. I felt almost like a movie
star, watching all the fashionable people of LA walk by while eating
food I had only ever seen on TV. It was magically, and going back
always reminds me of the show and that first bite of an amazing
cupcake.&lt;/p&gt;

section, and was surprised by two patterns in people's bucket lists:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Northern Lights seemed to be the most frequent single item. I
have no idea what would compel anyone to stand in freezing weather
in the middle of the night, but it will certainly take more than
lights to get me there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approximately 95% of bucket list items were places to travel to.
While I would have guessed travel to appear on most lists, I was
surprised that people didn't really seem to think of a bucket list
as much more than a travel check-list. While visiting places seems
cool, I guess I wished there were more creative ideas for things to
do or learn or make? That sounds so pretentious and judgey, but I
guess for this post I will accept my role as pretentious and judgey
narrator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But! It was a great read, because it inspired me to write my own
bucket list, which I later realized reveals how in my heart of
hearts, my deepest, truest self is a total square. So! Here is my very
boring bucket list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☐  Become a Senior Software Engineer
☑  Get a doggo
☐  Become financially independent (read: not need to work)
☐  Speak a little Spanish every day
☐  Bake cinnamon rolls (or maybe just eat a lot of cinnamon rolls...)
☐  Visit Boston
☐  Get married and have a family
☐  Be an extra in a film or a contestant on a game show
☐  Fly first class&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This honestly feels more like a list of long-term goals or a checklist
than a fun list of adventures (with a few exceptions, like eating a
lot of cinnamon rolls). Initially I was panicked by my apparent lack
of ambition or wanderlust. Didn't I want more from my one life than
this? Was being an extra in a movie really the most out-there, fun
thing I could think to do? But after reflecting more on my own list as
well as other common list items, I think this list is the best
reflection of me and the life I want to live. Of course I want to
travel more, and do more than is on this list, but I don't want it to
be prescriptive, or to feel as though I'm just checking things off a
list rather than pursuing new and exciting adventures. I want to leave
room for my list to change, knowing that my life and self are likely
to change. And honestly, I don't really want to see the Northern
Lights or run a marathon or go sky diving, all common bucket list
items that I can honestly say I have no desire to experience. So this
is it: a relatively short and boring list of things I want to do
before I die. #YOLO.&lt;/p&gt;

because I had a rather unlucky streak of uninspiring books. It wasn't
that these were &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; books, but they just weren't the type of books
that felt worth sharing. &lt;cite&gt;The Commitment&lt;/cite&gt; by Dan Savage is the perfect
example: while I enjoy Savage's writing, this was a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; book where
Savage tries to convince the (presumably liberal) reader that same-sex
marriage should be legal. Either you agree with him and gain nothing
from the book, or you disagree with him and only make it 2 pages in.
I didn't regret reading it, but definitely didn't think it was worth
writing about. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25810091-the-never-open-desert-diner"&gt;The Never-Open Desert Diner&lt;/a&gt; is another good example:
it was perfectly enjoyable but kind of weird and I don't know that I
would say I recommend it? It was pretty far outside of my typical
literary diet, and while it was great to step out of my comfort zone
I'd feel dishonest encouraging others to read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But! Things have turned around. I've read a number of great books over
the course of February and March, and have finally compiled enough to
warrant a post. I'm a few days past the 'Spring Reads' deadline, but
we'll call it Spring Reads anyway ;) Here's what I've been enjoying
lately:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-muse"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27213208-the-muse"&gt;The Muse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jessie Burton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book took me by surprise, and was such a delight! It's a clever
story with wonderfully complex characters, and who create great
tension and conflict with each other. It's so hard to write characters
who are all likeable and empathetic but still create believable
conflict, and Jessie Burton nailed it. A bit of a long one, but worth
every hour!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-grownup"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26025580-the-grownup"&gt;The Grownup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gillian Flynn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A half-step closer to horror than &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19288043-gone-girl"&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/a&gt;, this short story by
Gillian Flynn proves &amp;quot;Gone Girl&amp;quot; was no fluke. It's impossible to tell
what's true, who's lying, and what really happened. Strong female
lead, plot twists I never saw coming, and an open ending make this a
story that you'll keep thinking about long after putting it down.
Highly recommend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="lily-and-the-octopus"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27276262-lily-and-the-octopus"&gt;Lily and the Octopus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stephen Rowley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read this because it was the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://girlybookclub.com/"&gt;Girly Book Club's&lt;/a&gt; March read, and I
have mixed feelings about it. It's an unusual and heart-wrenching
read, but I didn't feel like it brought anything new to the
sad-book-about-a-dying-dog genre of books. The book follows Ted as he
grapples with the inevitable death of his beloved companion, a
dachshund named Lily. It was honestly hard to empathize with Ted, and
while there's no wrong way to grieve it was hard to be in the mind of
someone who is so lonely and who's only friend is a dying dog. At the
same time, it has rich descriptions, great characters, and is
excellent at making Lily a character as much as Ted. So...a mixed bag.
Read at your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="call-me-by-your-name"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/98687.Call_Me_by_Your_Name"&gt;Call Me By Your Name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;André Aciman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my favorite book ever. Period. The best movie, and the best
book. Elio is so expressive and emotional. As I've gotten older I
think I've lost touch with that emotional side of myself, for better
or worse. Especially in America I think it's typical to numb yourself
in order to 'get through' everyday life, and we quickly forget what
it's like to feel much of anything very strongly. &amp;quot;Call Me By Your
Name&amp;quot; reminds me to not be afraid of feeling too much, to be
vulnerable and present and that even the lows have a certain richness
to them when you really &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; them. I love the setting, I love the
story, I love the characters. I want to live in the world and the
character that Aciman has created everyday, and am glad that for at
least a few hours this week I was able to escape to that place. This
is definitely a read that I'll keep coming back to.&lt;/p&gt;

feel good, and that endorphin rush just can't be beat. However, since
I typically run early in the morning and listen to murder podcasts I
opt to use the elliptical at the gym in the mornings in place of
running. That said, this playlist is definitely applicable to whatever
cardio you're doing: running, elliptical, even biking! I have these in
a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/12152465230/playlist/559vjV4H1kJqp3ViHU93bD"&gt;spotify playlist&lt;/a&gt; (which gets updated frequently as I get bored of
songs), and generally just hit 'shuffle', but you could definitely
construct a more structured workout if you'd like. Anywho, finding
tempo songs that I like to workout to is a hard task, and I wanted to
provide my own list of songs that work for me and my pace (~9 minute
miles). Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="hills-120-140-bpm"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hills (120-140 BPM)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these songs also make great sprints! I sprint during the
chorus, when the songs tend to get faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;128 BPM     3:38    &amp;quot;Beautiful Now&amp;quot; by Zedd&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;136 BPM     3:42    &amp;quot;Jai Ho!&amp;quot; by A.R. Rahman, The Pussycat Dolls&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mid-Tempo (140-160 BPM)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are great for when you want to have a slower day, or are just
warming up / cooling down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;140 BPM     4:08    &amp;quot;50 Ways to Say Goodbye&amp;quot; by Train&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;140 BPM     3:13    &amp;quot;Up All Night&amp;quot; by One Direction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;142 BPM     3:38    &amp;quot;Geronimo&amp;quot; by Sheppard&lt;/li&gt;

dreaming of all the outdoor, evening-time activities we can start
doing again. And in a new city! I'm moving to Seattle in a week, which
means this Spring will involve a lot of exploring new places, new
experiences, and an opportunity to try new things. In addition to
being in a new place I'll also be living with my partner for the
first time in nearly 2 years, and having weekends back will hopefully
afford me more time to do fun things without having to travel from
city to city or spend the entire weekend with my partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this adds up to hearty bucket list for this Spring!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☑  Go to a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://girlybookclub.com"&gt;book club&lt;/a&gt; meeting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☑  Find a volunteering opportunity in Seattle (We're now official
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://emeraldcitypetrescue.org/"&gt;Emerald City Pet Rescue&lt;/a&gt; volunteers!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☑  Go to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/hot-cakes-molten-chocolate-cakery-seattle?adjust_creative=dWJMtmYxpd5N5yoyzSuhtA&amp;amp;utm_campaign=yelp_api&amp;amp;utm_medium=api_v2_business&amp;amp;utm_source=dWJMtmYxpd5N5yoyzSuhtA"&gt;molten cakes&lt;/a&gt; bakery in Capitol Hill&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☐  Find a Zumba class to go to regularly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☐  Go to a trivia night at a local bar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☑  Practice piano at least 3x per week&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☑  Go to at least 1 concert (I'm counting going to see Trevor Noah
here)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☑  Go to a Mariners game&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☐  Go to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.thestranger.com/events/25634435/skagit-valley-tulip-festival"&gt;tulip festival&lt;/a&gt; [and | or] the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.thestranger.com/events/25634454/apple-blossom-festival"&gt;apple blossom festival&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☑  Visit &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.kubotagarden.org/"&gt;Kubota Garden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, certainly seems like I'll be busy in the coming months. While
this list is admittedly a little overwhelming I plan to approach
moving to Seattle like starting college: try a lot of things, meet a
lot of people, and just see what sticks!&lt;/p&gt;

coffee, and if I keep it to about 12 oz. once a week I'm fine. But
much more than that, and my stomach just ties itself in knots! Don't
get me wrong, though: I still really like drinking coffee as a treat.
I drank coffee all through college, but on our way home from the UK in
August of 2016, I got super sick and couldn't keep anything but water
down for about 4 days. This was terrible, but it did kick my caffeine
addiction. Ever since then, my body just can't handle regular or high
doses of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While coffee isn't the drink of choice for me, I do still like to down tea
like Don Draper drinks whiskey. Over the years I've found a few
coffee-alternatives and teas that I really like, and if you're looking to
explore a coffee-free world (less terrible than it sounds!), here are my
recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="matcha-green-tea"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Matcha | Green Tea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic, I know. But I do genuinely enjoy matcha or green tea lattes.
Like coffee, there's a pretty noticeable difference between the good
stuff and the not-so-good stuff. While you don't need to buy anything
fancy or expensive, you are definitely getting what you pay for when
it comes to green teas. I really like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.stashtea.com/products/premium-green-tea-bagged"&gt;stash green tea&lt;/a&gt;, as it's not
too bitter but still has a strong flavor. For matcha, I like the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PFDH0IC/?tag=minimalistbaker-20"&gt;jade
leaf organic&lt;/a&gt;, which you can get on amazon. One thing to note is that
matcha powder definitely degrades over time. It doesn't quite &amp;quot;go bad&amp;quot;
per se, but again like coffee you want to buy in small doses so you're
consistently getting relatively fresh matcha. I've found that if my
matcha sits around for more than 6 months, it's probably not worth
having.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pero"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caro_(drink)"&gt;Pero&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pero is &amp;quot;made up of soluble solids of roasted barley, malted barley,
chicory, and rye.&amp;quot; While it doesn't taste exactly like coffee it's
hearty and savory in the same way coffee is, and holds milk and sugar
especially well. I like that it's a little bit filling and has a lot
of body to it, and it definitely quenches my craving for a coffee-like
drink. It's cheap, quick and easy to make too! Definitely my go-to
non-coffee drink for most mornings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="teeccino"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://teeccino.com/"&gt;Teeccino&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to Pero, Teeccino is just roasted barley and chicory that you
can steep that tastes somewhat like coffee. While pero, which is just
powder, is much easier to make (and you can make a much stronger cup
with it), teeccino definitely tastes more like coffee and comes in
lots of yummy flavors. It's a tea bag that you steep in really hot
water for 5-6 minutes, and I've found that one bag is good for ~12
ounces maximum, 8 ounces ideally. They're tasty, but pretty weak and
take a long time to steep enough. That said they are really tasty, and
definitely worth giving a try particularly if you don't mind weaker
coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="crio-bru"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://criobru.com/collections/crio-bru"&gt;Crio Bru&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the weird name, this is just roasted cocoa that you steep to
make a coffee-like drink, and as you might expect it is rich and
chocolately and absolutely delicious. There are only 2 real downsides:
1. You have to have a lot of it to make a strong cup, 2. You need to
make it like coffee, which can take a while and is a rather manual
process. I don't tend to make it at work because it takes a while,
requires special equipment, and pouring Pero into a cup and adding hot
water is just so much easier, if a little less tasty. But if you have
the time and wherewithal Crio Bru or any other cocoa coffee-substitute
is definitely worth trying!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="herbal-teas"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Herbal Teas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;em&gt;so many&lt;/em&gt; great flavors of herbal tea, and for the most part
this is what I drink all day every day. I love to have a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.stashtea.com/products/lemon-ginger-herbal-tea-bagged"&gt;lemon
ginger&lt;/a&gt; cup in the morning to get digestion moving and wake me up a
bit. Then I'll go for either &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.stashtea.com/products/peppermint-herbal-tea-bagged"&gt;mint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.celestialseasonings.com/products/herbal/sleepytime-classic"&gt;chamomile&lt;/a&gt;, or a tea you may
not have tried but which I highly recommend: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.yogiproducts.com/teas/best-selling-teas/egyptian-licorice/"&gt;licorice&lt;/a&gt;. What I like
about all these teas, especially the licorice, is that they're
slightly sweet and help satisfy my sweet tooth without being
overwhelming or involving a sugar crash later. I do also occasionally
love finding seasonal teas at the store, like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://steepster.com/teas/teavana/41066-white-chocolate-peppermint"&gt;white chocolate mint&lt;/a&gt;
tea at Christmas time or &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.davidstea.com/us_en/loose-leaf-tea-pumpkin-chai"&gt;pumpkin chai&lt;/a&gt; in the fall. Really, you
can't go wrong, and there are whole worlds of herbal teas to explore!
I highly encourage you to find one that strikes your fancy and give it
a try.&lt;/p&gt;

and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4555426/"&gt;The Darkest Hour&lt;/a&gt; are still getting attention, particularly compared to
movies like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5580036/"&gt;I, Tonya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5649144/"&gt;The Florida Project&lt;/a&gt; which are frankly not
getting the recognition they deserve. But whatever, white men clearly still run
the world and have a hard-on for watching other powerful men kill each other.
It's fine, everything is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, I plan to have a few sections to this piece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nominees you should see&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies not nominated, but worth watching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nominees worth skipping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Award predictions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to include a &amp;quot;What I Hope Wins&amp;quot; section, but honestly the movies I
love are not actually the highest quality movies. It's a hard distinction to
draw, but while I want 'Call Me By Your Name' to win everything and to have
Timothée Chalamet give his acceptance speech in French, it definitely wasn't
the best picture released last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, without further ado, here's my movie advice for this weekend:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-you-should-see"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What You Should See:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5726616/"&gt;Call Me By Your Name&lt;/a&gt;: Summer romance in Northern Italy, with Armie Hammer? Sign me up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5052448/"&gt;Get Out&lt;/a&gt;: The funny horror movie about race in America, this movie squarely hits the mark. Very well written + acted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4925292/"&gt;Lady Bird&lt;/a&gt;: While I don't fully appreciate why this movie is so critically acclaimed, it was a very enjoyable coming-of-age movie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5580390/"&gt;The Shape of Water&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Incredible&lt;/em&gt; acting, and way less weird than I expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5027774/"&gt;3 Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&lt;/a&gt;: Timely, touching, dramatic, memorable. This was, in every sense of the word, a great movie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5580036/"&gt;I, Tonya&lt;/a&gt;: Not only does it tell a well-remembered American story, but
&lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; this movie tells the story is sublime. The interviews, the
cinematography, the absurd characters. And that scene where Margot Robbie
cries in the mirror? Amazing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="not-nominated-but-still-great"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not nominated, but still great:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3890160/"&gt;Baby Driver&lt;/a&gt;: While I wouldn't consider this a &amp;quot;great&amp;quot; movie, it was so entertaining! I wish it had been nominated for more awards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5439796/"&gt;Logan Lucky&lt;/a&gt;: Same as above: this movie isn't the masterpiece that some of the movies above are, but was still very well done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0451279/"&gt;Wonder Woman&lt;/a&gt;: Hopefully everyone has already seen this, but if not &lt;em&gt;what are you doing I'm worried about you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="don-t-bother-seeing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don't Bother Seeing:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5294550/"&gt;All the Money in the World&lt;/a&gt;: I appreciate Michelle Williams off-screen, but literally the chair I sat in was a better actress than she was in this film.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4555426/"&gt;The Darkest Hour&lt;/a&gt;: Do yourself a favor and don't pay $10 to take a nap, and watch &lt;em&gt;yet another&lt;/em&gt; WWII movie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5013056/"&gt;Dunkirk&lt;/a&gt;: Literally could be the same movie as The Darkest Hour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4209788/"&gt;Molly's Game&lt;/a&gt;: While this wasn't a bad movie, I didn't love it and wouldn't recommend it. It was just kind of boring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="i-haven-t-seen"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I Haven't Seen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5776858/"&gt;Phantom Thread&lt;/a&gt;: Because I heard it was super boring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6294822/"&gt;The Post&lt;/a&gt;: Because I heard it was super boring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="predictions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Predictions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="best-picture"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Best Picture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Will Win&lt;/strong&gt;: 3 Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri
&lt;strong&gt;What Should Win&lt;/strong&gt;: 3 Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri
&lt;strong&gt;But I would also be fine with&lt;/strong&gt;: Get Out, Call Me By Your Name (certainly my favorite of the 9), Shape of Water&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="best-director"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Best Director&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Will Win&lt;/strong&gt;: Guillermo del Toro
&lt;strong&gt;Who Should Win&lt;/strong&gt;: Greta Gerwig, obviously
&lt;strong&gt;But I would also be fine with&lt;/strong&gt;: Literally anyone besides Christopher Nolan, though I would admittedly be pretty disappointed if PTA won as well (he won't, but just saying).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Best Actor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Will Win&lt;/strong&gt;: Gary Oldman, &amp;quot;The Darkest Hour&amp;quot;
&lt;strong&gt;Who Should Win&lt;/strong&gt;: Michael Shannon, &amp;quot;The Shape of Water&amp;quot; (not even nominated)
&lt;strong&gt;But I would also be fine with&lt;/strong&gt;: Daniel Kaluuya, &amp;quot;Get Out&amp;quot; or Timothée Chalamet, &amp;quot;Call Me By Your Name&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Who Should Win&lt;/strong&gt;: Frances McDormand, &amp;quot;3 Billboards&amp;quot;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="supporting-actress"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Supporting Actress&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Will Win&lt;/strong&gt;: Allison Janey, &amp;quot;I, Tonya&amp;quot;
&lt;strong&gt;Who Should Win&lt;/strong&gt;: Allison Janey, &amp;quot;I, Tonya&amp;quot;
&lt;strong&gt;But I would also be fine with&lt;/strong&gt;: Laurie Metcalf, &amp;quot;Lady Bird&amp;quot; or Octavia Spencer, &amp;quot;Shape of Water&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, that about sums it up! We saw a lot of incredible movies in 2017, and with &lt;a class="reference internal" href="#black-panther"&gt;Black Panther&lt;/a&gt; 2018 is already off to a good start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="target" id="black-panther"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

and her go-with-the-flow, you-only-live-once-so-make-the-best-of-it
way of living is truly inspiring.  She posts &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://joythebaker.com/recipe-index-2/"&gt;great, easy recipes&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is considered a 'design' blog, but honestly most of their
posts are just stories about being a human in the world. I love W+D
for connecting me to other women around the world and understanding
what's on their mind. What's it like to start dating again at 40?
What's it like to have a miscarriage? What &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; happen when you tried
not wearing a bra for 30 days? Understanding others experience through
beautiful story-telling; my kind of blog!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://cupofjo.com/"&gt;A Cup of Jo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd describe Cup of Jo as 'a little bit of everything'. Her posts are
typically short and casual, almost like checking in with a friend once
every few days, and Joanna has created a wonderful community of
uplifting women. I love that Cup of Jo isn't &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to be anything,
or telling you how to live your life. It's just an upbeat check in, a
&amp;quot;y'know what I was thinking about earlier today&amp;quot;. I don't know. It's
hard to describe. I highly recommend it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="carly-the-prepster"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.carlytheprepster.com/"&gt;Carly the Prepster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does anyone else go through weird periods of obsession with a
particular &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; (song, movie, artist, etc.)? I'm currently crushing
&lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; on Carly. I know it's a phase and that it will pass, but for
now I just love reading her blog and following her on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/carly/"&gt;insta&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/collegeprepster"&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;. She just seems so kind and upbeat, put-together without
being overly primped, and I love her sense of style. I don't typically
think of myself as a 'preppy' person, and wouldn't spend as much money
as I think she does on my closet, so my obsession seems a little...out
of left field. But for now I'm going with it! (And actually, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnX9INqSflA"&gt;this
video&lt;/a&gt; inspired me to start trying to blog more!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/magazine-tip"&gt;NYT Tip Column&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About once a week the NYT will post a short column with basic tips on
how to do something. This week it was &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/magazine/how-to-take-a-vow-of-silence.html"&gt;How to Take a Vow of Silence&lt;/a&gt;.
It can be anything. How to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/magazine/how-to-climb-a-coconut-tree.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fmagazine-tip"&gt;climb a coconut tree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/magazine/how-to-eat-spicy-food.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fmagazine-tip"&gt;write a love letter&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/magazine/how-to-write-a-love-letter.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fmagazine-tip"&gt;eat spicy foods&lt;/a&gt;. I love spending a little time
each week pondering following the advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="young-house-love"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.younghouselove.com/"&gt;Young House Love&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned John and Sherry's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.younghouselove.com/category/podcast/"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; in my list of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.lucywyman.me/podcasts.html"&gt;favorite
podcasts&lt;/a&gt; a while back, and while their banter on air cannot be beat
I also enjoy reading their blog! While they are much more handy and
DIY than I ever expect to be, it's very fun to see the projects they
take on. This is the only real 'home design' blog I read, and it's a
good exercise in contemplating the space I'm in. I also love their
upbeat attitudes, and reading about their lovely family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="money"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="frugalwoods"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.frugalwoods.com/"&gt;Frugalwoods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Frugalwoods live a life of frugal luxury on a homestead in Vermont, where
Mrs. Frugalwoods write funny and hearty soliloquies on personal finance,
answers reader questions, and describes their lives in rural Vermont. I love
Mrs. Frugalwoods writing style, and her positive attitude towards frugality.
It's hard to put my finger on what in her voice and content resonates so much
with me, but she is hands down one of my favorite writers of any platform. I
highly recommend if you're looking to up your financial game (or like
beautiful pictures of rural New England).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="mr-money-mustache"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mrmoneymustache.com/"&gt;Mr. Money Mustache&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MMM is THE personal finance blogger, at least in the nerdy circles I run in.
And for good reason: his approach is very similar to the Frugalwoods, which
is living below your means, spending on what matters to you, and growing your
money correctly. MMM is definitely a bit snarkier than the Frugalwoods, but
also has great writing style and aligns very strongly with my personal
values. Preach!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://thepowerofthrift.com"&gt;The Power of Thrift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Anita doesn't always (or even often) blog about finance, I honestly really like reading about her day to day life, her goals, and the books she's reading. More of a lifestyle blog than a financial blog, but very much like catching up with a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="fashion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fashion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="style-bee"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Style Bee&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEE. Like so many, I was enamoured with Caroline Rector of Un-fancy (see
below) for years until she teamed up with Lee of Style Bee. And my life
changed forever. Lee is an ethical fashion blogger, and her style is
&lt;em&gt;incredible&lt;/em&gt;. If I could style myself half that well...Lee is the best way to
learn about responsible fashion brands, and see them styled + modeled. I love
love love her blog, and can't wait to read more now that she's a full time
blogger!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="un-fancy"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Un-Fancy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OG in ethical fashion blogging (at least to me), Caroline has pretty much
stopped blogging at this point. But it's still fun to read through the
archives of her capsule wardrobes, and be inspired by her amazing photography
and closet. An oldie but a goodie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's it! My favorite blogs to read. I hope you found one that you will fall in love with or be inspired by!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

wanted to reflect on what I had learned in the last year. As I wrote
during my recent &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/2017-year-in-review.html"&gt;new years post&lt;/a&gt;, this last year has not been the
most exciting year, and I'm honestly a little glad it's over. But!
Like any year, a lot of things happened, I grew a lot, and marking
those transitions is important to continuing to grow. So here are my
take-aways from a year of being 22:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I miss playing the piano. I played for most of my childhood, mostly
out of obligation to my parents but somewhat for myself. But I
stopped playing when I went to university; despite having pianos
available for playing on campus, it was hard to make a habit out of
playing and I had to go out of my way to play. Now that there's no
piano available to play I really miss creating music in my life,
and whenever I hear songs I used to play I long to tickle the
ivories again. I'm hoping to acquire a piano once we're in Seattle
so I can play again!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; exercise to stay sane. I've always known that exercise
played a key role in maintaining my mental health, but when I took
just 3 days in a row off over Christmas (I usually take 2 days off
per week, but not in a row) I could immediately feels the
difference in my mood. I was cranky, anxious, and slightly
depressed, despite being in a beautiful place surrounded by people
I love during a happy time of year, and it made me realize that
getting my heart rate up and endorphins flowing regularly is a
necessary part of my life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don't have any food sensitivities! I did the whole30 during the
month of July, and while it was a great exercise in discipline and
resetting my system, I didn't feel any adverse effects after
reintroducing all the foods. Honestly, this has given me a lot of
peace of mind since doing the experiment. I never have to wonder if
that weird feeling in my stomach is because I had a glass of milk
-- it definitely isn't. I never have to consider if gluten-free is
a better option for me -- it's not. Nutrition is super personal,
and experimenting with my own diet has paid off tremendously!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am, however, very sensitive to the cold. We spent 3 weeks in
Tokyo, and as always while travelling internationally I learned
something about my bodily needs: cold Lucy is not fun Lucy. I was
too cheap to buy a jacket in Japan, and in hind sight it would have
been money well spent to help me enjoy the trip and not dread being
outside. Lesson learned: spend the money, and be warm!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team. Jess. It was almost a year ago now, but I marathoned Gilmore
Girls last winter and am still crushed that Rory didn't end up with
the smoldering, smart, bad-boy love of her life she was clearly
meant to be with. And no, I did not watch 'A day in the life'.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can run 13.1 miles in a row without stopping, and not die.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never be afraid to rock a dark lipstick. It doesn't look as stupid
as you'd think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are &lt;em&gt;so many&lt;/em&gt; things I don't know. Like most people my perceived
intelligence has fluctuated a lot over the course of my life, and this
past year it's definitely been a year of particularly low
perceived-intelligence. As always, it's less what you know and more about
what you 'know you don't know'. So I should say, there are now &lt;em&gt;so many&lt;/em&gt;
things I know that I don't know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I wanted to write 22 things that I learned but it's already 2
weeks past my birthday and I still haven't thought of any more. Better done
than perfect!&lt;/p&gt;

a 3½ week stay in Japan. In a word the trip was &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;, but like most
international travel there were a lot more nuanced ups and downs, interesting
experiences, and fresh perspectives provided by being in a different country. I
originally meant for this to be a condensed 'recap' of our trip, kind of a
virtual answer to the question &amp;quot;How was it?&amp;quot;, but it ended up being more of a
ramble on how Japan was different from America. I'll have a separate post that
goes through all the things we did (maybe in installments so it isn't super
long?), but for now here are my fresh thoughts on living in Japan for 3 weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very first thing you notice when you arrive in Japan is how much
stereotypes about Japanese bodies hold up. People in Japan are just smaller
than in America, both in terms of height and weight. They're also much
more physically homogeneous, not facially but in terms of height and hair
color and physique. I can count on one hand the number of times I saw someone
with dyed hair, or who reached above 5'10&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/corn-soup.jpg" style="height: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing I noticed was the abundance of vending machines. We made it a
point to seek out vending machines before coming to Japan without realizing
that they. would. be. EVERYWHERE. In the airport. On the train from
the airport (literally on one of the train cars). In subways. On every street
corner. You could be standing in one place and have 6 or 7 vending machines in
your field of vision. It was bananas. Most had small coffees, teas, waters, and
sodas for $1 - $1.30, but some would have more interesting fare like canned
corn soup or peach coca colas. Also! They could have both cold &lt;em&gt;and hot&lt;/em&gt;
beverages! So your $1 coffee could double as a hand warmer for the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/eli-with-deer.jpg" style="height: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convenience stores were similarly lush throughout Japan. I expected them to
be primarily in Tokyo and city centers, but even in our travels to tiny towns
and remote subway stations there were convenience stores. There are exactly 3
convenience store 'brands' in Japan: Lawson, 7-11, and Family Mart. Lawson is
definitely the best: they tend to be the cleanest, have the best selection,
and have the most fresh food. 7-11 is a close runner up, and could sometimes
be slightly cheaper depending on what you were getting. Family Mart was a last
resort, and while it's not like the place was terrible it was usually more
expensive, had fewer fresh items, and was just less tasty than the other
stores. They also had the worst bathrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of cleanliness, Japanese hygiene is very interesting and distinct
from America. I think most people would say that the Japanese are much more
clean and hygienic than Americans, but it's more than the Japanese are wary
of different bacteria vectors than Americans. For example, when in doubt
always take off your shoes. Going into a dressing room? Remove your shoes.
The dentist? Remove your shoes. And of course, the Japanese are known for
their hind-quarter cleaner &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidet"&gt;the bidet&lt;/a&gt;, which is common even in public toilets
(and very useful!). However, washing your hands isn't super big in Japan. The
water is always cold, there isn't always soap, there's nothing to dry your
hands with, and most people I saw in public restrooms would either not wash
their hands or would only briefly run them under water for a few seconds.
Mind you this was sometimes in restrooms that had &lt;em&gt;heated toilet seats&lt;/em&gt;. At the
gym, everyone always always always would wipe down equipment after using it,
even if they weren't sweating or had only held a barbell for a few reps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/eli-mickey-glasses.jpg" style="height: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that stood out was how &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; is wrapped in &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; one
layer of plastic, usually more. I kid you not, we saw individually
plastic-wrapped carrots. One roommate alleged to have seen plastic wrapped
&lt;em&gt;grapes&lt;/em&gt;. Everything is wrapped in plastic, and even the smallest purchases
from a store are put into tiny plastic bags before you have finished pulling
out your cash to pay. Yet, for the volume of plastic garbage we created, there
are exactly zero public trash cans. We would have 2-3 plastic bags full of
trash by the end of the day, and would just carry them with us until we got
home (or snuck into a 7-11 to throw our trash out there).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/mountain.jpg" style="height: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last, more subtle thing I noticed during our time in Tokyo was how nicely
everyone dresses. While we did do a lot of our wandering during the work week,
and a lot of it was in areas of town where you might expect folks to dress
nicely, even when we were at a sporting events or in the shopping district on a
weekend people were dressed up. Most women wear heels of some sort, people had
very nice wool coats, and even men seemed to really care about how they looked.
Almost &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; was wearing jeans, except maybe people working in bakeries and
such. While this may have just been the parts of Tokyo we were in and the times
we were out, over the course of the trip I noticed often enough to think it's
more of a pattern. I also come from Portland, probably the most casual city in
America, so perhaps my standards are just especially low (shrug).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this isn't an exhaustive list of our observations and experiences it
seems like enough for one post for now! Stay tuned for more Japanuary
debriefing later this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Reflect on them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've been meaning to read more but aren't sure how to get started, or
aren't satisfied with your current reading process, this post is for you!
Some parts of the process I've been doing for years, others are parts that I'm
actively working to do more diligently and improve at. Let's dive in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="finding-books-to-read"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finding Books to Read&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this isn't a very universal or sustainable way of finding books
to read, but I honestly just go to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://powells.com"&gt;Powell's&lt;/a&gt; books in Portland, OR and see
what's on their shelves that looks interesting. They have a wide selection of
new books, sprinkled with classics and a-few-years-ago best-sellers, and
wandering their aisles + checking the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://powells.com/staff-picks"&gt;new and recommended&lt;/a&gt; list provides me
with plenty of reading suggestions! One caveat: this definitely involves
judging books by their covers, and I'm not ashamed of it. I honestly like
reading books that I know nothing about because it avoids coloring my
experience with expectations, and much like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem"&gt;the halting problem&lt;/a&gt; you can't know if
you'll like a book until you've read it anyway. So, a cover seems a fine thing
to judge it by. I also occasionally will have books recommended through blogs I
read, people I talk to, or just general gossip, but for the most part I find
books through Powell's. If you're not in Portland, I highly recommend finding a
local book store and doing the same!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="acquiring-books"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Acquiring Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the rare exception of cookbooks or books I want to take notes in, I get
all of my books from the library through &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://overdrive.com"&gt;Overdrive&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://meet.libbyapp.com"&gt;Libby&lt;/a&gt; is their new
app -- I haven't tried it yet, but have heard great things!). You can get
e-books (for kindle, or that you can read on your phone or laptop) or audio
books, and depending on the book they get new releases pretty quickly (e-books
faster than audio books). In general I'd say about 80% of the books I'm
interested in reading are available, and those that aren't I request from the
library and they tend to get there eventually. The library automatically checks
books out for you when they become available, and you have them for 3 weeks and
can renew them if you aren't finished, just like for the 'regular' books. I
love getting books this way because it's 1. Free, 2. Supports our local
library, and 3. Makes it super easy to listen to and read books. You can even
listen at faster or slower speeds, add bookmarks, and see the history of books
you've read. It's a &lt;em&gt;fantastic&lt;/em&gt; resource, and I can't recommend it highly
enough!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="reading"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a capital-m Millennial, I tend to prefer audiobooks to e-books so that I
can &amp;quot;read&amp;quot; while commuting, doing chores, running errands, and so on. After
discovering Overdrive about 3 years ago, I went from reading maybe 4 books a
year to reading at least one book each week, and it's completely changed my
life. While listening to books is definitely a different and less engaging
experience than reading them, I simply don't have the time to sit down and read
very often, and audiobooks have made the entire world of books available to me
in a way literature never was before. It's also had the side-effect of making
chores, commuting, and other boring activities things I actually look forward
to, as it's a chance to listen to a story and unwind from the day. Like food,
reading is a personal business, and you should do what works for you. But if
not having time to read is what's been holding you back from picking up a book,
I highly encourage you to give audiobooks a try!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="reflecting"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reflecting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the part I'm especially terrible at. I was pretty good about writing
short &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/tag/book-review.html"&gt;book reviews&lt;/a&gt; of the books I read for a while there, but fell off the
wagon and have never managed to get back on since. I know &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://goodreads.com"&gt;Goodreads&lt;/a&gt; is a
great resource for reflecting on books, and even better having discussions
about them, but I've also not been keeping up with that either. For now, my
reflection is mostly internal, but this is something I'm working to change!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's it! This process has worked for me for years, and I hope there's
some helpful hint here that will help you read more and enjoy what you read! If you're not sure which books to start with, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/category/books.html"&gt;here are some of my favorites&lt;/a&gt;. Happy reading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

for me this year (and most years) feel more like decades. I'm not sure why time
moves so slowly for me (and I'm certainly not sad about it!), but thinking back
to last January it feels like a whole lifetime ago. Was it really only 11
months ago that I was marching Portland's streets on a cold and rainy Sunday?
Only 7 months ago I visited Austin? Only 3 months ago we were hiking the Redwoods?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's because a lot happened this year. Eli graduated! I moved to a new
position at work. We took a road trip to California. But mostly this year has
felt like a lot of waiting. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/reflections-on-2016"&gt;2016 was a life-changing year&lt;/a&gt; in so many
ways (some good, some with orange hair), and 2018 will likely be just as
momentous. We're taking a 3 week vacation to JAPAN in January (Japanuary), then
Eli and I are moving to Seattle with 2 good friends and starting our life
together. 2017 has been the in-between year. The middle child of years. The
long-distance-relationship, long-work-hours,
long-time-waiting-for-Eli-to-graduate year. Perhaps that's why it's moved so
slowly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, while 2017 may not be as remarkable as the years that surround it, it's
worth reflecting on. Here goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What am I most proud of?&lt;/strong&gt;
I'm most proud that I was able to maintain some of my most valuable
relationships this year, and prioritize them. This was Eli and my first (and
hopefully only) full year of dating long-distance, and I'm proud that we were
able to still feel close as a couple. I'm proud to have 2 wonderful friends
that I got to spend a lot of time with, and that I was able to be there for my
family through good times and rough times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What area did I struggle with the most? And what lesson did I learn from that struggle?&lt;/strong&gt;
Spending my first year in corporate America. This was my first full year in
&amp;quot;The Grind&amp;quot;, and while I love my job and the organization I work for I
understand how easily a corporate job can become your entire identity, and how
empty that would feel. I've struggled with feeling terrible at my job, with
finding a sense of identity and purpose outside of work, with feeling chained
to my desk and wondering whether I'm making the world a better place. I'm
incredibly fortunate to have a job I look forward to, that supports me in so
many ways and which is incredibly flexible and lucrative. In so many ways, I
won the lottery with this position. But, even my organization isn't exempt from
the realities of being a business in America, and the cultural norms that go
with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are my 3 happiest memories?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spending the day with my mom at The Grove. Although our early-December trip
was already planned, my grandpa died just weeks before we were scheduled to
visit. He was 94, lived a good and long life, but it was still a blow to my
mom. We had a few days to spend in LA before the funeral, and while we
should probably have spent more time helping my grandma move things or
visiting other relatives we did what my grandpa would have wanted us to do:
eat cake, shop, and gaze in awe at the beautiful people of LA. It was just
the perfect day in the sun with my mom, despite all the sadness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dinner at Fogo de Chao to celebrate Eli's graduation. I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; food, and
while I don't eat a lot of red meat I definitely appreciate a good meal. And
this was the best! Going to FdC felt really special, we were there for 3+
hours, the food was amazing and it was great to celebrate with Eli's family.
Definitely a special meal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who did I spend the majority of my time with? Was that energizing or draining?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eli, obviously. I love spending time with Eli. He calms me and my anxiety,
grounds me, and I feel so at ease when I'm with him, like there's no where else
I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to be or anything else I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What new skills, hobbies or activities did I try this year?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a salsa class! I'm so glad I took it, but I also didn't renew it after
the first month. I think, ultimately, I just need to make time to do fun things
like that. I think Zumba might be in my future? We'll see once we move to
Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What money was the best spent?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What is one thing I created this year?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Who or what am I the most grateful for?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What surprised me the most?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="looking-ahead"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As previously stated, there's a lot in store in 2018 for me. I'm not a big
resolutions person, but next year I want to make a conscious effort to &lt;strong&gt;have
fun&lt;/strong&gt;. Once I started working, it's so easy to just be &lt;em&gt;tired&lt;/em&gt; all the time,
and feel like you have to save your energy for the weekdays. I keep having to
remind myself that I am 22 years old for goodness sake, and that I'm allowed to
be more spontaneous, make a few mistakes, and not need to live such a routine
and orderly life. In the next year I'd like to try to do more things that bring
me joy, and not worry so much about being in bed by 9 every night. My wallet,
my body, and my work can handle a little less discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

more than ever. There are tons of fun Portland Christmas things to do, some
of which are traditions with my family that I look forward to each year.
Others on this list are to remind me to have fun, indulge, and enjoy this
beautiful season. I know talking about 'slowing down' and 'self caring' is
cliche and overused at this point, but I do find myself rushing through my
days without pausing to reflect, assess, or just absorb. The Holidays seem
like a good time to, cliche as it is, &lt;em&gt;slow down&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough ado, here's what I'm looking forward to doing this season:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☑  Walk down &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.peacocklane.org/"&gt;Peacock Lane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☑  Watch the tree light up at Pioneer Square&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☐  Decorate a tree&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☑  Volunteer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☑  Bake some &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://joythebaker.com/2014/05/the-best-brown-butter-chocolate-chip-cookies/"&gt;cookies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☑  Visit Santa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☐  Write Christmas cards for friends and family&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☐  Watch Elf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☑  Enjoy some hot chocolate (maybe some &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cacaodrinkchocolate.com/"&gt;drinking chocolate&lt;/a&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☑  Enjoy a coffee from a local shop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☐  Go to a Christmas Bazaar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☑  Wear a bold lip color at least once&lt;/p&gt;

to light, our first instinct is to mourn the loss of the people we thought we
knew and loved. Though we always knew, somewhere, that their personas were a
well-crafted act they &lt;em&gt;felt&lt;/em&gt; so genuine and real. We thought we &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; Matt
Lauer, or Louis CK, or Charlie Rose, and losing our perception of these artists
is, in it's way, a kind of death in the family. &amp;quot;No, don't take Savannah from
me too!&amp;quot; my mom cries, hearing rumors that Savannah had an affair with Lauer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I don't understand this. Each time the gross sexual misconduct of a
celebrity is brought to light, the women in my life act as if something
has been lost, because for them it has been. But they always fail to
acknowledge the incredible gain that these stories have: &lt;strong&gt;that we will live in
a safer, more just world&lt;/strong&gt;. Their daughters won't have to spread their legs to
get the starring role, or ignore come-ons and grabs at an office party as if
they aren't happening. Their sisters won't live in fear of being alone in a
room with their boss, or have the powerful take advantage of them. And if they
do experience any of that? They can tell someone, and know &lt;em&gt;someone will listen
and care&lt;/em&gt;. They'll know that it isn't OK, that this isn't the world we want to
live in, and that their perpetrator will be brought to justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not advocating we give up our love of celebrity and fame here (though I do
think considering it's magnitude and taking a step back could benefit
everyone). You can still love an artist's work, and condemn the actions of the
artist. But I want the women in my life to stop letting nostalgia and &amp;quot;it's how
we were raised&amp;quot; cloud their responses to these allegations. I want us to
acknowledge how incredible it is that stories are not just being told, but
&lt;em&gt;heard&lt;/em&gt; and acted upon. &lt;strong&gt;It's OK to mourn the loss of artists we love, but we
also need to add &amp;quot;How disgusting. I'm so glad that she spoke up.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;. We need to
celebrate that even the most powerful among us must face consequences for
hurting others, and that our culture is shifting to empower victims of sexual
harassment and assault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you reminisce about Kevin Spacey, or Al Franken, what I hear you saying is
&amp;quot;Their career is more important than hers anyway. If that happened to someone I
knew, I hope she'd reason about whether it was really worth it to destroy a
person's career and future just because she was uncomfortable&amp;quot;. I know, that's
not what you mean. But it's what you're saying. And it sucks knowing that
that's what the people I love think. I hope we can do better.&lt;/p&gt;

finds you well! It's that time of year again: the leaves have, fallen, the
chill has set in, and the holidays are just over the horizon. I always find
myself reading more in the winter, when it's too cold to leave my apartment and
nothing sounds better than a mug of tea and a book. Whether you're travelling
to visit family, or have some cozy mornings in your future, here's what I can
recommend adding to your reading list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS I'm not a professional enough blogger to make commissions or
anything, but I do have a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/2016-book-gifting-guide.html"&gt;book-themed gift guide&lt;/a&gt; for all the readers
in your life. And we're all readers! Check it out if you're not sure
what to get someone. Ok, on with our regularly scheduled program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="too-fat-too-slutty-too-loud"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33257571-too-fat-too-slutty-too-loud"&gt;Too Fat, Too Slutty, Too Loud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Anne Helen Petersen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="static/too-fat-too-slutty-too-loud.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expected this book to be yet another ranty read about how oppressed women
are. While I think those books are important and read a lot of them, it's
draining to read about the systemic problems and rarely be presented with
solutions. &amp;quot;Too Fat, Too Slutty, Too Loud&amp;quot; absolutely blew me away though.
Petersen's writing is precise, intelligent, and clear, and I found myself
having 'Aha!' moments at least once per chapter. A great read for any feminist
(aka everyone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-music-got-free"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23398715-how-music-got-free"&gt;How Music Got Free&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Stephen Witt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="static/how-music-got-free.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another book I expected to be dull, but which turned out to be great! Rather
than laying out the facts in chronological order, &amp;quot;How Music Got Free&amp;quot; wove
together the stories from 3 people who contributed to the rise and fall of
the pirated music industry. It's an epic story, told more like a novel than a
non-fiction account. Thoroughly entertaining and interesting, whether you
like (and pirate) music or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love everything Cheryl Strayed writes. If she wrote a phone book, I'd
probably read it. Her work is consistently thought provoking, concise,
beautiful, and profound, and &amp;quot;Tiny Beautiful Things&amp;quot; is quintessential Cheryl.
A compilation of advice columns, &amp;quot;Tiny Beautiful Things&amp;quot; is all about
understanding the human experience. Part poetry, part therapy, entirely worth
reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="static/commonwealth.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book may not be for everyone, but as a reader who loves a good cast of
characters &amp;quot;Commonwealth&amp;quot; was right up my alley. The characters were rich and
realistic, and the plot follows the story of a blended family we know all to
well with an unexpected twist. An excellent low-stress read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know you already know this one, so let me just throw my recommendation in with all the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="turtles-all-the-way-down"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35504431-turtles-all-the-way-down"&gt;Turtles All the Way Down&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you're not a young adult, John Green's latest novel is a wonderful
and quick read. It's narrated by the protagonist, Aza Holmes, a young woman
trying to live with and manage obsessive-compulsive disorder while trying to
be a good daughter, good friend, and a good detective. What I loved about it
was that it helped me understand at least one person's experience of mental
illness, and helped humanize and sympathize disordered thinking for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be perfectly honest, the only reason I wanted to do this is because I
submitted a talk to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://puppet.com/puppetconf"&gt;PuppetConf&lt;/a&gt; on the subject and it got accepted. Woops.

&lt;div class="section" id="how"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the basic steps we'll be taking to set up a puppet agent running on
CoreOS, all running in Vagrant (because I'm too cheap to buy cloud space for
this).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="stand-up-puppet-master-and-agent"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stand Up Puppet Master and Agent&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I wanted to do was get some basic Puppet infrastructure up that
I could integrate my CoreOS nodes into. I used the following Vagrantfile and
provisioning scripts to get my VMs running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also installed the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/oscar-stack/vagrant-hosts"&gt;vagrant-hosts&lt;/a&gt; plugin to make sure the VMs could talk to
each other, and minimize the amount of networking voodoo I had to do:
&lt;code&gt;vagrant plugin install vagrant-hosts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
$ tree

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Configuration file for the virtual machines we'll install puppet master and agents on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code ruby literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="no"&gt;Vagrant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;configure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;vm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;define&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;puppetmaster&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;master&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;

container into our puppet infrastructure. This involves a lot of changes, so
let's break it down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the following block to your Vagrantfile in the 'config' block&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code ruby literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;vm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;define&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;coreosagent&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;agent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# On VirtualBox, we don't have guest additions or functional vboxsf&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lastly add a &lt;code&gt;user-data&lt;/code&gt; file (your cloud-config file)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
#cloud-config

hostname: coreos-agent

coreos:
  units:
  - name: puppet.service
    command: start
    content: |
      [Unit]
      Description=Puppet
      After=docker.service
      Requires=docker.service

      [Service]
      TimeoutStartSec=0
      ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker kill puppet1
      ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker rm puppet1
      ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/docker pull puppet/puppet-agent

      [Install]
      WantedBy=multi-user.target

  - name: 00-ens192.network
    runtime: true
    content: |
      [Match]
      Name=ens192

      [Network]
      DNS=10.20.1.82
      Domains=coreos-agent
      Address=10.20.1.82
      Gateway=10.0.2.2
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we'll get that machine up and running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
vagrant up
vagrant ssh coreosagent
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And wham, you're in a coreos machine!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="connecting-agent-to-master"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Connecting Agent to Master&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing left to do is start our puppet agent container on the CoreOS VM and get it connected to the master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="add-puppet-conf-to-agent"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Add puppet.conf to agent&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since our CoreOS machine doesn't know it's a puppet agent yet (or about puppet at all), we need to manually add &lt;code&gt;/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf&lt;/code&gt; to configure the agent that will run in a docker container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="test-it-out"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Test It Out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, let's make sure our setup is actually working!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="resources"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fair warning: This article assumes that you have a decent
understanding of Openshift from the outset, because explaining all the
concepts used here would take too much space. I'll try to link to
resources where applicable though, so that words don't go undefined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The typical happy path for using &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://docs.openshift.org/"&gt;Openshift&lt;/a&gt; is to use it's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build"&gt;Source
to Image (s2i)&lt;/a&gt; builder to take a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.2/dev_guide/builds.html#source-code"&gt;git repo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.2/dev_guide/builds.html#dockerfile-source"&gt;dockerfile&lt;/a&gt; and
turn it into a container running on Openshift. In general, this works
just fine. The s2i builder &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.Openshift.com/enterprise/3.1/dev_guide/new_app.html#language-detection"&gt;detects which language your app is using&lt;/a&gt;
and deploys that application appropriately, including starting the
webserver. However, if your project needs more dependencies than
Openshift expects, it's very difficult to add those dependencies to
the container. For good reason, your user in the container is pretty
neutered, which means installing a package is impossible.  And you
don't have access to the processes that are installing dependencies
for your application, since those come from the default (probably
CentOS or RHEL) base image that Openshift uses. So, what do you need
if you need to install a package in your container? We'll explain!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, you'll need to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the s2i builder that your application is using (based on it's language)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modify it as necessary for your application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new application in Openshift that uses your Dockerfile to create an image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create your &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; application in Openshift, using the image you just created as a base and the Source strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll go through it step by step!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="copy-the-default-s2i-builder"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Copy the Default S2I Builder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to find the s2i builder your application will need is to
reference the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.Openshift.org/latest/using_images/s2i_images/ruby.html"&gt;Openshift S2I documentation&lt;/a&gt;, find the language your
application is in, and then in the first paragraph there should be a
link to the git repo where the default s2i builder for that language
lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="static/Openshift-s2i-docs.png" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching for 'Openshift $LANG S2I builder'
also usually resulted in the first hit being the &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; s2i
builder, but the git repos don't make that clear so going through the
documentation should give you a little more certainty you found the
right one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally cloned the whole repo, then copied the relevant files into a
subdirectory of my application so that everything I needed was
packaged together. Later on, this will make things a little easier. If you'd rather separate your concerns though, you
can also fork + download + modify the s2i builder and keep it separate
from your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what my application directory ended up looking like, where everything
under &lt;code&gt;openshift-build&lt;/code&gt; is copied from the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sclorg/s2i-ruby-container/"&gt;Openshift ruby s2i&lt;/a&gt; repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key to Success&lt;/strong&gt;: Make sure you include everything in the &lt;code&gt;s2i&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; directories from the default s2i builder! These files are
necessary for building your first image later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="modify-as-necessary"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Modify As Necessary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trying to trick Git into thinking I had a user on Openshift, so
that I could clone some dependencies for my application. I also needed
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.npmjs.com/"&gt;npm&lt;/a&gt; for Reasons. I looked at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sclorg/s2i-nodejs-container"&gt;nodejs s2i builder&lt;/a&gt;, which uses
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cwrap.org/nss_wrapper.html"&gt;nss_wrapper&lt;/a&gt; to achieve the Git-trick, and just copy-pasted the
important bits (apologies that the application isn't open source so I
can just reference it):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;     INSTALL_PKGS=&amp;quot;rh-ruby24 rh-ruby24-ruby-devel rh-ruby24-rubygem-rake rh-ruby24-rubygem-bundler rh-nodejs6 rh-nodejs6-npm nss_wrapper&amp;quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \
---
&amp;gt;     INSTALL_PKGS=&amp;quot;rh-ruby24 rh-ruby24-ruby-devel rh-ruby24-rubygem-rake rh-ruby24-rubygem-bundler rh-nodejs6&amp;quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also added &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sclorg/s2i-nodejs-container/blob/master/4/root/opt/app-root/etc/generate_container_user"&gt;this file&lt;/a&gt; from the nodejs builder to &lt;code&gt;$APP_ROOT/openshift-build/root/opt/app-root/etc&lt;/code&gt; so that my application could use nss_wrapper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="create-application-from-dockerfile"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create Application from Dockerfile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to create an image in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/dev_guide/managing_images.html#accessing-the-internal-registry"&gt;Openshift internal
repository&lt;/a&gt; from our special S2I build. This will be the base
image for our application, instead of the default Openshift builder
image. I personally found this a little bit easier to do in the UI
than on the CLI, but will explain both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key when you create this application is to use the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.2/dev_guide/builds.html#docker-strategy-options"&gt;Docker source
strategy&lt;/a&gt; using the Dockerfile (and all the other files!) you copied
from the default s2i builder. This is where it comes in handy to have
those files inside your application: if you point Openshift to where
those files are (&lt;code&gt;spec.strategy.dockerStrategy.dockerfilePath&lt;/code&gt;
in the buildConfig), Openshift will use that for it's Docker build
strategy. As I describe in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/deploy-private-git-repo-to-openshift.html"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt;, it's difficult to create
a new application using your own buildConfig. I didn't feel like
messing with templates at this point, so I just:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Created an application using the default image for ruby&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited the buildConfig&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rebuilt the application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how it went down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: I recommend naming this first application 'myapp-builder',
or something along those lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="in-the-cli"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;In the CLI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;oc new-app &amp;lt;appropriate configurations&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. As previously mentioned, Openshift will detect the language your application is in and use that default image. I highly recommend running &lt;code&gt;oc new-app --help&lt;/code&gt; to see if there are any other options you'd like to use!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;oc edit bc/myapp-builder&lt;/code&gt; and modify the strategy section of the buildConfig to have the following:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
strategy:
  type: Docker
  dockerStrategy:
    dockerfilePath: openshift-build/Dockerfile
    env:
      - name: MYVAR
        value: my_value
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close and save the buildconfig.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;oc start-build myapp-builder&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="in-the-ui"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;In the UI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: I believe the UI workflow only works if your file source is Github, not a Docker image&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click 'Add to Project' in the header navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="static/add-project.png" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the language (and version, etc.) your app is in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fill out the application details appropriately. There's nothing special you need to do on this page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now that you've created your application, go to 'Builds -&amp;gt; Builds' in the left navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the application you just created&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the top right, select 'Actions -&amp;gt; Edit Yaml'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modify your buildConfig to use the Docker source strategy. The key changes here are under the &lt;code&gt;strategy&lt;/code&gt; section. You should end up with something that looks like this:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
strategy:
  type: Docker
  dockerStrategy:
    dockerfilePath: openshift-build/Dockerfile
    env:
      - name: MYVAR
        value: my_value
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then save the config
8. In the top-right corner, click 'Start Build'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you're done! The resulting image will be published to the internal container registry with the label 'app-name:latest'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="create-application-from-source-using-image"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create Application from Source, Using Image&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final step, creating our application image from the image we just
created! The key when creating this application is to use the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.2/dev_guide/builds.html#source-to-image-strategy-options"&gt;source
strategy&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;your image&lt;/strong&gt; as the
&lt;code&gt;source.strategy.sourceStrategy.name&lt;/code&gt; value. This should be the
name of the application you just created. The steps for creating this
application are more or less the same as they were in the previous
step:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an application using the default image in your language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit the buildConfig&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rebuild the application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can follow the same steps enumerated above for the preferred
interface, and here's roughly what your buildConfig should look like
when you're finished:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
strategy:
  sourceStrategy:
    env:
    - name: MYVAR
      value: my_value
    from:
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: myapp-builder:latest
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last line being the critical point! Make sure you're referencing your builder image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there you have it! Once you've rebuilt your application, you're
all set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="making-changes"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making Changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you make changes to &lt;em&gt;your application&lt;/em&gt;, you only need to rebuild
the application, not the application builder. However, if you make
changes to your Dockerfile or any other part of the underlying image
(say you need another package installed), then you will need to
rebuild the app-builder image &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="resources"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Openshift is in an interesting place developmentally, where they have
pretty good documentation, relatively mature technology, and awesome
tech support on IRC, but almost no community documentation (think blog
posts, stack overflow questions, etc.). I would often find myself
reading a post from the Openshift blog that was published in 2013, and
hope it was still relevant, or be looking through github issues and
irc logs for answers. But, there were still a number of resources I
found very helpful through this journey:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, I &lt;em&gt;highly&lt;/em&gt; recommend asking any questions in #openshift
(irc.freenode.net). Folks were kind, quick to respond, super
helpful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.openshift.com/promotions/for-developers.html"&gt;Openshift book&lt;/a&gt; is a great resource if you have the time. I would suggest only reading the first 1/3 of it or so to understand core concepts, then starting your own project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.2/dev_guide/builds.html"&gt;This doc&lt;/a&gt; is the best &amp;quot;Everything you need to know about Openshift builds&amp;quot; documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.openshift.com/create-s2i-builder-image/"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is a
pretty good resource on the anatomy of an s2i builder, though
definitely isn't required reading for this post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

repo, or binary) and then builds an Openshift docker image from that.
Because I'm using this as a project for work, and my application
already lives on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to use a private Git repo as my
source for deploying my application to Openshift. Deploying public Git
repos is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/application_lifecycle/new_app.html#specifying-source-code"&gt;well-documented&lt;/a&gt;, and while private repos don't require too
much additional setup there were a few hiccups along the road, and no
great step-by-step resource. So...I decided to write my own!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="notes"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id2"&gt;Notes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This assumes that you already know &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://developers.openshift.com/"&gt;what Openshift is&lt;/a&gt;, and have some basic Git and web application knowledge. I essentially wrote what I wish I had read 2 days ago -- if there's any context you're missing I've tried to provide as many resources I think would be useful at the end of this article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This also assumes you're on Linux, and I am far too lazy to find how to do all of this on other systems. If these don't work on OSX or Windows, maybe you should consider a different operating system?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="overview"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id3"&gt;Overview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="contents topic" id="contents"&gt;
&lt;p class="topic-title first"&gt;Contents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="#notes" id="id2"&gt;Notes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 0 is to install the Openshift CLI. I generally find CLIs easier
to use + understand, but Openshift also has a nice GUI you can use
if you'd prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: this assumes that you already have access to and Openshift
instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases#Downloads"&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Untar &lt;code&gt;tar -xvzf openshift-origin-client-tools-v1.5.1-7b451fc-linux-64bit.tar.gz&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move binary into path &lt;code&gt;mv openshift-origin-client-tools-v1.5.1-7b451fc-linux-64bit/oc /usr/local/bin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: If you're not sure what's in your path, run &lt;code&gt;echo $PATH&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="create-an-openshift-project"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Create an &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/projects.html"&gt;Openshift project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where our applications, builds, etc. will live. I highly
recommend running &lt;code&gt;oc new-project -h&lt;/code&gt; first to see if there are
any flags or arguments you want to pass in! I just ran &lt;code&gt;oc
new-project &amp;lt;project-name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pause"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id6"&gt;Pause&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop right here! Usually, the tutorials will tell you to make your
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://developers.openshift.com/managing-your-applications/creating-applications.html"&gt;Openshift application&lt;/a&gt; next and pass in your Git URL. DON'T FALL FOR
IT. The problem is that for private repos, you need to have a deploy
key so Openshift can authenticate with the repo. However, the only way
to tell Openshift it needs the SSH key is in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/builds/index.html#defining-a-buildconfig"&gt;buildconfig&lt;/a&gt;. And
the buildconfig isn't generated until you either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to create an application (the first build will fail then you can
modify the buildconfig) OR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a template (basically write your own reusable buildconfig).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up using a template, because it drove me nuts to have the
first build of the application fail. But you can see a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.openshift.com/using-ssh-key-for-s2i-builds/"&gt;step-by-step
guide for option 1 here&lt;/a&gt;
if you'd prefer to modify an existing buildconfig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="create-an-ssh-key"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id7"&gt;Create an SSH Key&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so, adding a deploy key to both our Github and Openshift. First things
first, lets make a special key (Don't use your own personal SSH key!
Make a new one!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C &amp;quot;openshift-key&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Make sure you give it a unique path, so that it doesn't
overwrite any existing SSH key(s)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="add-public-key-as-a-deploy-key-to-repo"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id8"&gt;Add Public Key as a Deploy Key to Repo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we'll add the public key to our private Git repo as a deploy key,
so that it can verify communications with Openshift. See Git's
slightly more helpful documentation on how to do this &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#deploy-keys"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the repos main page in Github&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the 'Settings' tab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to 'Deploy keys'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give it a name (can be anything)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paste the &lt;strong&gt;public&lt;/strong&gt; key (&lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/id_rsa-openshift.pub&lt;/code&gt;) into the textbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click add key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="add-key-as-a-secret-to-openshift"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id9"&gt;Add Key as a Secret to Openshift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have to give Openshift the private key, and make it an
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/dev_guide/secrets.html"&gt;Openshift secret&lt;/a&gt;. Openshift secrets &amp;quot;decouple sensitive content
from the pods that use it and can be mounted into containers using a
volume plug-in or used by the system to perform actions on behalf of a
pod&amp;quot;, which is very useful!  Creating them requires a few steps (read
more about why in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.openshift.com/deploying-from-private-git-repositories/"&gt;this poorly named blog post&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;oc secrets new-sshauth openshiftkey --ssh-privatekey=$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa-openshift
oc secrets add serviceaccount/builder secrets/openshiftkey
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you accidentally add the public key like I did, you can remove
secrets using &lt;code&gt;oc delete secret openshiftkey&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="create-openshift-application"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id10"&gt;Create Openshift Application&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; that our keys are all squared away, we can create an
application using a private git repo as our source! Unfortunately,
there's currently no way to use the &lt;code&gt;oc new-app&lt;/code&gt; command
directly to build an image from a private repo. What we'll do instead
is create an &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/templates.html"&gt;application template&lt;/a&gt; that includes the necessary
secret and use that template to create our app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Create a template for our git repo using the new-app command&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;oc new-app ssh://git@github.com:mygituser/mygitrepo --name app-name -o json &amp;gt;&amp;gt; my-template.json
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Open the JSON file and change &amp;quot;List&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Template&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;items&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;objects&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Add a &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;my-app-name&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;metadata&lt;/code&gt; object&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;quot;metadata&amp;quot;: {&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;my-app-name&amp;quot;},
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;This part is tricky and I'm not sure how best to describe it, but in &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;spec&amp;quot;: {&amp;quot;source&amp;quot;:{}}&lt;/code&gt; object add&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;quot;sourceSecret&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;openshiftkey&amp;quot;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you should end up with a block that looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;quot;spec&amp;quot;: {
...
    &amp;quot;source&amp;quot;: {
        &amp;quot;type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Git&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;git&amp;quot;: {
            &amp;quot;uri&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ssh://git@github.com/puppetlabs/pe-console-ui-code-coverage&amp;quot;
        },
        &amp;quot;sourceSecret&amp;quot;: { &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;openshiftkey&amp;quot; }
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/lucywyman/145aebfe1897d91d4cd5337e5baa7379"&gt;This is what my JSON template ended up looking like&lt;/a&gt; (with sensitive
information removed)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Create a template based on this json file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;oc create -f my-template.json
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Finally, create an application using the template!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;oc new-app --template app-name
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I highly recommend you run &lt;code&gt;oc new-app -h&lt;/code&gt; first to see if there are any special configurations you want to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="make-sure-it-worked"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id11"&gt;Make Sure It Worked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;oc get builds&lt;/code&gt;, and you should see output similar to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;NAME      TYPE      FROM          STATUS     STARTED        DURATION
my-app1   Source    Git@abcdefg   Complete   18 hours ago   29s
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="issues-i-ran-in-to"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id12"&gt;Issues I Ran In To&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-wrong-git-uri"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id13"&gt;The Wrong Git URI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I was using the http Git URI, which obviously didn't use
the SSH deploy key. I then tried using
&lt;code&gt;ssh://git&amp;#64;github.com:my-user/my-repo.git&lt;/code&gt;, which also failed.
&lt;code&gt;git&amp;#64;github.com:my-user/my-repo.git&lt;/code&gt; is the right URI!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="application-already-exists"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id14"&gt;Application Already Exists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I had to try building my application several times, I also had
to delete my failed attempts several times so there wouldn't be name
errors. I usually ran the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;oc delete all --selector app=app-name
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should delete all resources for the app&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="resources"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id15"&gt;Resources&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openshift.org/latest/welcome/index.html"&gt;Openshift Origin&lt;/a&gt; documentation was invaluable in
troubleshooting various issues I had&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I asked a question in #openshift on irc, and someone answered within
5 minutes and was very nice and helpful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://openshift.com/promotions/for-developers.html"&gt;Free E-Book&lt;/a&gt; (pdf format too) call &amp;quot;Openshift for
Developer's&amp;quot; that explains more about what Openshift is and how it
works. This was super helpful for understanding what all of the
components were, and generally getting started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kitchens of the Great Midwest is just about the sweetest book.
Following the life of Eva Thorvald through the eyes of those around her,
this book details the joys and pains of growing up in the midwest. Filled
with food and a kindness only midwesterners can muster, KotGM is the
perfect compliment to sunshine and lazy days in the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite it's tongue-twisting title, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29238798-how-everything-became-war-and-the-military-became-everything"&gt;How Everything Became War, and
the Military Became Everything&lt;/a&gt; might be the best book I read all
year. The military has never been part of my family or culture, yet as
an American has tremendous impact on my life. A former Pentagon
reporter, Rosa Brooks brings incredible insight into the current state
of the military, and how it got to where it is. What influence does it
yield? Why? What are the consequences of that? I learned &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt;
reading this book, and like all the best books it gave me new
perspective and understanding of the world we live in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-magnolia-story"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28668633-the-magnolia-story"&gt;The Magnolia Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Chip and Joanna Gaines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I know I know I know I know. Judge all you want, I am
head-over-heels for Chip and Joanna Gaines, and their book did not
disappoint. They're so funny! And cute!  Perfect for beach reading and
flower gazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Sylvia Plath&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bell Jar flat out surprised me. I think of it as Classic Literature,
and often find that Classic Literature is too masculine or too opaque for
my casual reading tastes. This book was anything but! Plath's
semi-autobiographical novel is the beautiful story of a young woman trying
to find her&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="beautiful-ruins"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11447921-beautiful-ruins"&gt;Beautiful Ruins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Jess Walter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to conceive of a book that successfully explores so many characters,
time periods, locations, and relationships in a cohesive story. But Walter is
able to take us from the Italian coast in the 1960's to modern day Hollywood to
the middle of nowhere Idaho without muddling the story or confusing the reader.
Rich characters, interesting plot, and Hollywood glamour make this a delightful
read.&lt;/p&gt;

Many of these are time-honored traditions in my family, so this is more of a
reminder to partake than an aspirational list. Nonetheless, it bears writing
and checking in. Here's what we're planning on doing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☑  Take a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.vmacpdx.com/salsa.html"&gt;Salsa class&lt;/a&gt; (I'm already signed up!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☐  Go to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://oakspark.com/"&gt;Oaks Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☑  Attend the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://oregonstatefair.org/"&gt;Oregon State Fair&lt;/a&gt; (and maybe submit a baked good...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☐  Go berry picking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☑  Go to Shakespeare in the Park in Seattle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☑  Have a barbecue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☐  Go to trivia night&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☐  Go to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.lastthursdayonalberta.com/"&gt;Last Thursday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☑  Bake some bread. Yeast scares me, and I want to get over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all! Short. Sweet. Doable. Makin' the most of those summer nights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="faq"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FAQ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How was OSCON?&lt;/strong&gt;
Overall, this was an excellent conference! I'm not sure if the quality
of speakers was especially high this year or if I'm just getting
better at choosing which talks to attend, but I was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; impressed
with the speakers and their topics. There were only 1 or 2
talks that weren't useful to me, and even then I didn't find myself
wishing I had attended a different talk. I learned a lot, got to catch
up with OSS nerd friends, and got to meet some fantastic folks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did your talk go?&lt;/strong&gt;
Very well! As the speaker it always feels like there are a million
little things you should have done differently (I should have
introduced this topic sooner, I should have defined this phrase, I
should have put my contact info &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt; in the slides, etc.). But
attendees were engaged and attentive throughout the presentation, lots
of people asked good questions, and those that I spoke to said they
had clear takeaways from the presentation. Could it have been better?
Definitely. Was it helpful to those who attended? Definitely. Looking
back I consider it a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you like Austin?&lt;/strong&gt;
Visiting Austin was also fun. As one of those people who is always
cold I love visiting warmer climates, even if it's overcast and muggy.
There was an abundance of good food (I'll take 3 fried avocado tacos
please thank you), cute parks and urban hiking, and fantastic street
art. There was also live music &lt;em&gt;at the airport&lt;/em&gt;. I was also visiting
with a friend who had already been in Austin for 2 weeks (for
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://austin.dreamhack.com/"&gt;DreamHack&lt;/a&gt;), and later with a friend who lives in Austin, both of
whom were tremendously helpful in navigating the city and it's many
attractions. Would I visit again for a vacation? Probably not at the
top of my list. But if OSCON &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to be somewhere other than
Portland, I definitely didn't mind it being in Austin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, on to the session I attended throughout the conference!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx/public/schedule/detail/59367"&gt;Step 1: Punch a Tree&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was one of the most polished, entertaining, and well done talks
I've seen in a while. It packed a punch, and was put together without
being over the top. The &amp;quot;slides&amp;quot; were amazing (I had never seen slides
like that before, or even thought to do something similar), the videos
and sound effects were appropriate, well timed, and placed well
(again, without being over the top), and the message was a truly open
source and resonant one. Evan spoke about hardware hacking, and
advocated for general parts to be standardized and made
interchangeable like how batteries are now. For example, why can't we
have motors be widely available and easy to replace in everything from
toys to microwaves to blenders? An excellent and inspiring note to start on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Christopher Aedo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another excellent keynote! Chris works for IBM, which at a conference
like OSCON tends to make the audience skeptical. Chris' talk was
anything but a product pitch though -- he spoke about how we can make
infrastructure (read: compute storage and networking) more open across
the industry. He spoke about the business benefits of using open
source, how to build or choose infra tools using 3 open source
principles, and listed common tools that met all 3 of those
principles. There was no mention of IBM, or even any projects or
products they were working on, just some hard core pro-open source
talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Open Source Principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency&lt;/strong&gt; - do they work openly?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interoperability&lt;/strong&gt; - can I get my data off the platform? Or am I locked in?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Influence&lt;/strong&gt; - do they listen to non-paying users?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Dianne Marsh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Dianne used Netflix project &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.spinnaker.io/"&gt;Spinnaker&lt;/a&gt; as a case study
for how to successfully collaborate with other companies, in the
context of open source. It was an interesting an insightful talk,
and made me hopeful that companies like Netflix will continue to do
open source right. Dianne also made some good points about how
to successfully collaborate (in this case across companies), notably:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build trust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to communicate effectively (whatever that means for your
specific team + companies)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Value input from everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't lose sight of your objective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is pretty standard advice, I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think that a project is
less likely to succeed without these. Overall, interesting but not
mind blowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Ying Xiong&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was awesome to see a non-US speaker on stage, and I definitely hope
to see more non-US based technologies, companies, and individuals
speaking at OSCON in the future! That said, I think this talk in
particular missed the mark. It was Huawei paying lip service to open
source with misspelled slides and no clear point besides an
unconvincing &amp;quot;Huawei supports open source&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Brian Behlendorf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain"&gt;block chains&lt;/a&gt; are super cool, but this was a weird
keynote. Maybe that's only because I'm not used to business-y
keynotes, but this was 5 minute talk that included the phrase &amp;quot;This is
as exciting as when the internet was starting&amp;quot; and a plea to come to a
talk later that day. Mad respect to Brian, but I think this felt out
of place and insincere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Alvand Salehi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a very corny Don Draper giving this talk. Alvand is a
physically beautiful human who is, like, 5 years away from being a
really great speaker. But right now he is completely Over the Top. My
favorite quote from this talk was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'And then, they did something &lt;em&gt;even bolder&lt;/em&gt;: they open sourced their
project. It gives me chills just thinking about it'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of the talk was super interesting though. Alvand works for
the US government, and talked about &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://code.gov"&gt;code.gov&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://sourcecode.cio.gov/"&gt;Source Code
Policy&lt;/a&gt;, and other efforts within the government to promote open
source and deduplicate software usage throughout the government. He
talked specifically about &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/deptofdefense/anet"&gt;anet&lt;/a&gt;, a little tool to track which NATO
advisors have trained which Afghan officials, and spoke about the team
which led that project and what helped them succeed. It was honestly a
really good keynote, despite (or maybe including) the speaker's
hilarious exaggerations and style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="my-talk"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="#my-talk"&gt;My Talk!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First session Wednesday morning was my talk! First, I have to say that
I was bizarrely calm before giving my talk. The kind of nerves I get
are usually a very physical kind, where for the full hour before my talk
starts I'll have butterflies in my stomach, and sweaty palms, and
short breath. But this time none of that happened. &lt;em&gt;shrug&lt;/em&gt;. Maybe my
body is catching on that public speaking isn't scary? But about the
talk! It's so hard to have perspective about talks you give, and so my
initial reaction when people asked how it went was to say &amp;quot;Oh, there
were so many things I could have improved or done better&amp;quot;. For
example, I completely neglected to include any contact information or the link
to my slides in my presentation. But everyone I spoke to after the
talk, even those who had constructive feedback, told me that they had
really enjoyed the talk and had gotten something out of it. Overall
I'm reasonably pleased with how it went, have a list of notes to
myself for future versions of this talk, and sincerely hope that I was
able to make contributing to open source software a little less
intimidating for someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="finding-your-way-in-the-dark-security-from-first-principles"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx/public/schedule/detail/57236"&gt;Finding your way in the dark: Security from first principles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Susan Sons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you secure the equipment used to measure water movement below
ice floes? Or equipment taking measurements in a volcano? At the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.nsf.gov/"&gt;National Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, these are the kind of questions Susan
Sons is asked. This talk was really great for a few reasons:
1. It presented general lessons that anyone in the room could use
2. It also provided specific examples to illustrate how to apply those lessons.
3. It supported it's claims
4. Susan told interesting stories, and was clearly an incredibly competent and knowledgeable human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this is to say that talks without the above are bad, but I
think these things were at least part of what made Susan's talk an
incredibly successful one. I walked away with a new set of tools that
I could apply to my job (and likely future jobs), a full understanding
of how to use those tools, and more knowledge about &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae"&gt;Thermopylae&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susan talked about 7 principles that help guide and support decisions
about how to secure a wide variety of systems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comprehensivity&lt;/strong&gt; - Am I covering all my bases?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opportunity&lt;/strong&gt; - Am I taking advantage of my resources?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rigor&lt;/strong&gt; - What is correct behavior, how am I ensuring it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimization&lt;/strong&gt; - Can this be smaller?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compartmentalization&lt;/strong&gt; - Is this made of distinct parts with
limited interactions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fault Tolerance&lt;/strong&gt; - What happens if this fails?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proportionality&lt;/strong&gt; - Is it worth it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After introducing the principles, the rest of the talk used examples
to color in details on how to apply the principles and justify their
place in the list. If you have the time and are interested in
security, I highly highly recommend watching!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx/public/schedule/detail/57075"&gt;Enhancing cloud security with the TPM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By James Bottomley&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another excellent talk! James talks at a mile a minute, though I was
lucky to know juuust enough background knowledge to be able to keep
up. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module"&gt;The TPM&lt;/a&gt; is a small chip that's used to securely generate,
store, and limit use of cryptographic keys. James talk was
about using the TPM to store cloud machine's secrets, specifically VPN keys and
potentially RSA keys. There are a number of stumbling blocks towards
this goal, not the least of which is a radical difference in how the
TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0 work (which makes backwards compatibility
difficult at best and impossible at worst). I had never heard of the
TPM before this talk, and while I can't say I fully grok how it might
be used in the future it certainly seems worth knowing more about and
keeping an eye on, in the context of security in the cloud! Definitely
worth a watch if you are mathematically or security inclined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="stephen-king-s-practical-advice-for-tech-writers"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx/public/schedule/detail/55872"&gt;Stephen King's practical advice for tech writers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Rikki Endsley&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll start by saying I adore Rikki. I've only met her a few times, but
she's always lovely, welcoming, and easy to talk to. She spoke about
tips for writing, most of which are relatively common knowledge but as
an occasional writer I found them both inspiring and helpful! It never
hurts to be reminded of how to structure your articles based on your
audience, have a clear point, and that the only way to get better at
writing is by writing. Rikki also provided a number of tech-industry
specific tips (how technical to be in various articles, for example),
as well as a number of quips from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/150292-on-writing-a-memoir-of-the-craft"&gt;Stephen King&lt;/a&gt; (kill your darlings,
kill your darlings). Although this was a &amp;quot;common knowledge&amp;quot; type
of talk, it's also the talk I got the most out of in the
whole conference, particularly since writing plays such an important
role in my job and life. I was reminded to edit my pieces (woops,
don't usually do that!), to learn to handle criticism, and to know who
I'm writing for. Overall, a super worthwhile and excellent talk from a
true expert (and open source hero!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before you write know what you are writing about, why you're writing, and who your reader is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research, outline, write, revise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 categories of audience in tech: lay audience, managers, experts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good writing requires lots of reading and writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have clear expectations for what your piece needs to deliver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invite the reader in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell a story&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave out the boring parts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include lists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To write is human, to edit is divine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kill your darlings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a brutally honest editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start writing!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-i-learned-to-stop-being-afraid-and-love-the-jvm"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx/public/schedule/detail/56563"&gt;How I learned to stop being afraid and love the JVM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By James Turnbull&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, if you're reading this post straight through, I know at this point
it might seem like I loved &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the talks I went to at OSCON,
which makes loving a talk feel cheap. Let me assure you that 1. This
is an anomaly, and 2. There will be less great reviews later on! I
think this a combination of OSCON attracting particularly stellar
speakers this year, as well as my own increased skill in finding which
talks I want to go to and can get the most out of. Or maybe I'm just
really happy as I'm writing this because I'm heading home and get to
see my boyfriend in an hour. Who knows. But I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James' talk about how the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine"&gt;JVM&lt;/a&gt; has improved since the mid-2000s was
also excellent. As someone who never writes java and only occasionally
interacts with the JVM via &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.braveclojure.com/"&gt;clojure&lt;/a&gt;, I wasn't sure if I would have
enough context to get much out of this talk. But James explained in
great detail the pain points and horror stories of the old JVM that
many grizzled sysadmins will tell you about. His talk set up the
problem, explained how the JVM has improved and how those improvements
have made impacts in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legacy java is pretty ugly, verbose, and repetitive. And there's &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of bad java out there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JVM has always been generally performant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JVM doesn't always respond to general fixes (for example, you have to tell it to use more memory, not just throw memory at it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JVM needs tuning, not always intuitive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JVM stacktraces are impossible to read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard to automate the JVM (mentioned Puppet!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JVM wasn't transparent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android has really helped modern java improve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JVM is &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; fast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logging has improved dramatically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More transparent now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security has become a much higher priority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Christian Wenz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last talk of the day is a tough slot, but Christian made HTTP headers
both interesting and hilarious. This talk covered the major threats
facing web applications today (namely &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)"&gt;XSS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_hijacking_attack"&gt;Cookie hijacking&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)"&gt;CSRF&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/01/21/meta-referrer/"&gt;referrer data leakage&lt;/a&gt;), and what we as web developers
can actively and easily do to prevent those attacks. Favorite quote was&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;To allow inline javascript, I need to add &lt;code&gt;script-src unsafe-inline;&lt;/code&gt;. Writing 'unsafe-inline' feels so good.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://content-security-policy.com/"&gt;Content Security Policy&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.w3.org/"&gt;W3C&lt;/a&gt; standard for security related http header content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://caniuse.com"&gt;https://caniuse.com&lt;/a&gt; to look up which security policies are supported by which browsers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSP works by having the header and a 'directive', for example &lt;code&gt;default-src 'self';&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Saron Yitbarek&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking questions is scary. It means you have to admit you don't know
the answer, and puts you in a vulnerable position. But asking
questions is key to creating a successful project, and often the
hardest questions are the most important. Saron was well-spoken, and
while this talk wasn't anything revolutionary it was something we
could all be reminded of regularly, and included some excellent
personal stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Brad Fitzpatrick&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was just a cute telling of Brad's time in open source software,
from learning Perl as a teenager to spending 7 years working on Go.
Included were some wise words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy != quick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything has maintenance cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All code you put online will end up in production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing especially insightful, but a really nice story that I hope a
lot of people in the room could connect to. I love hearing how open
source changes people's lives, and this was an excellent open source
love story well told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Stephanie Hurlburt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VR is cool! This talk wasn't especially insightful, beyond &amp;quot;Lots of VR
development is open source, here are some resources&amp;quot;, but if you're
really stoked about VR it's likely worth watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Liz Baillie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this conference wasn't already chock full of outstanding talks, I
would say this was the best talk of the conference. In addition to
being a programmer Liz is a comic artist, storyteller, and game
developer, all of which came together in an illustrated (and narrated,
&lt;em&gt;with voices&lt;/em&gt;) guide to Rust. I loved that Liz was totally silly
throughout the talk, and although the metaphor sometimes made her
points opaque some aspects of Rust are common knowledge enough that it
would make sense to most people. After describing her adventures in
&amp;quot;Rustlandia&amp;quot;, Liz spoke about her programming experience with Rust,
and compared / contrasted writing a text-based game in Ruby and Rust.
This was a unique, fun, and informative talk delivered with
confidence, poise, and silliness all in good measure. The kind of
speaker I strive to be!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Meaghan Lewis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a classic conference mistake with this talk: I already knew a
lot
about the subject. While I didn't gain any new insights, I was still impressed with the content and structure of the
talk! Meaghan covered common issues one might run in to when testing
using Selenium across multiple browsers, and what might be causing
those issues. She also prescribed some patterns that can help avoid
this issues (like using &lt;code&gt;data-test&lt;/code&gt; selectors in your html), and
talked about some general testing best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Jessica Rose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was like the talk version of a self-help book: mostly generic
advice that's really difficult to implement. Jessica seemed aware of
this, repeating a few times &amp;quot;This is easier said than done&amp;quot;, but that
didn't make her content any more useful or meaningful. Such advice
included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone in your organization should know what open source means to your org, and why it's important for your org&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your open source org should balance transparency with too much information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborative conflict and compromise are what drive the product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And don't get me wrong, all of this is &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; advice. We should all
be transparent, and make compromises that drive our product, and be
open to feedback. We should also probably stop having so much pizza
and wine. By the end of the talk I didn't know any more about how to
have a successful open source company, or even what I could do to
advocate for open source within my company. A good topic, and good if
irrelevant advice, but overall and underwhelming talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Alex Martelli&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, by this point my brain was definitely not running on all
cylinders, so I can't say I got as much out of this talk as I might
have liked. But Alex presented an interesting idea: to have the same
set of tests run for both unit and integration tests, with the main
difference being mocked vs real dependencies (like databases, modules,
etc.). This gave you a unified set of tests, and helps avoid making
some 'white box' assumptions in unit tests. The rest of the talk went
through 'layers' of modules (from low-level modules that many things
depend on, to high-level ones that nothing depends on) and talked
about how to use unit and integration tests at each layer. Being in
QA, I think if I had a few more years of experience under my belt this
talk could have been &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; valuable, and provided ideas for how
to apply these concepts in my job. At this point, though, it just
seems like a neat idea for Later Down the Road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="other-notes"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a speaker, I like to take note of interesting slides or speaking
techniques, and there were a number of great ones at this conference!
Here were a few notable speaking styles I admired:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx/public/schedule/detail/59367"&gt;Step 1: Punch a Tree&lt;/a&gt;, I don't know that I can describe the slides but just watch the video and be in awe. This talk also included music and video, both of which I thought were used &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; well, which is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; difficult. Standing ovation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole Engard of Red Hat wrote a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://opensource.com/article/17/5/making-your-first-open-source-contribution"&gt;nice article&lt;/a&gt; about my talk!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was one of the better OSCONs I've been to, and I came away
inspired and excited about my industry and community. I learned that
the first step is to punch a tree, that TPM stands for more than just
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethered_particle_motion"&gt;tethered particle motion&lt;/a&gt;, and that learning rust is just a
sea of bacon away. Looking forward to next year, when OSCON will be
back in my beautiful hometown &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/portland.html"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

the mind, and her experiences with mental illness.
Semi-autobiographical, the language Plath uses to describe her/Esther's
outlook, experiences, and later treatments is &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt;. Her writing
puts the reader right into Esther's head, and gives them an
understanding of what living with a mental illness is like. Even
better, her language changes throughout the novel as Esther's health
changes, reflecting her darker moods, as well as her better days.
Esther is a fantastically sympathetic and vibrant character, despite
her cynicism and depression. I found myself really invested in her
story and experiences, and again Plath's writing paints a luscious
picture of that story. I don't want to oversell this novel -- I think
part of why I loved it is because I came into it expecting it to be
Yet Another Classic Book which I often find to be overly masculine.
But this wasn't. Throughout the book, even at the peak of Esther's
descent into mental illness, I found myself identifying really
strongly with her and investing in what happened to her. It feels rare
to read a book in a woman's voice that's highly regarded, and I was
very pleasantly surprised by the femininity that colors the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this was another great read. Again, expectations definitely
may have played into my reading, but on the whole I was blown away by
the style, substance, characters, and story of The Bell Jar. Highly,
highly recommended summer reading!&lt;/p&gt;

did differently, or which stars were aligned, but I was able to do
more work than I typically do, in less time, and felt energetic and
good while doing it. I was telling Eli about it later, and said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;2017-04-17 11:54:21 lucyw   I&amp;#39;m tentatively thinking about working up
to a half marathon. I think so much of training to run long distance
is really just building up the lung capacity + strength, and it&amp;#39;d be
cool to just see if I can do it. I wasn&amp;#39;t sure if you were interested
in trying to run it (or part of it) with me
2017-04-17 12:14:58 pop I&amp;#39;d be up for a half marathon.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's how I decided to run a half marathon.  It hasn't been a
lifelong goal of mine or anything, or something I thought I would ever
do. It always seemed nearly-but-not-quite-impossible, something I
could probably do if I ever wanted to but which I would never want to
do enough to make it manifest. This would be a fun experiment though.
Could I do it? If not, no big deal -- my expectations would be met, I
would get a good workout in, high-five myself for trying, and move on.
The date was set for Saturday, where we would just give it a try and
see how it went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-day-before"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Day Before&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it's currently Friday April 21, 2017, and the fella and I are
(tentatively) planning on running 13.1 miles tomorrow. We're doing it
on our own, and have both made it clear that we can stop or walk or
give up and go get donuts instead at any time. But I'm curious to see
if I can (we both know he can, skinny jerk). I'm also SUPER NERVOUS.
What if I hurt myself? What if it's hard (it's &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; going to
be hard)? What if I have the wrong shoes and fuck my foot up, or don't
bring enough water, or try to bring too much water and it's too heavy?
I know nerves are normal, and keep reminding myself that this is a
pretty low stakes event that I can bail on at any time. But that
doesn't stop my brain from being like &amp;quot;STRESS STRESS SELF-DOUBT STRESS
NERVES STRESS&amp;quot;. We'll see if I even do it. Though this blog post won't
see the light of day if I &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; do it, so...I guess if you're
reading this, I probably did it. Congratulations, future me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-few-hours-after"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Few Hours After&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler Alert: We did it! We ran 13.1 miles in about 2 hours and 17
minutes (give or take, we weren't super precise). I have a lot of
feelings, some of them conflicting, but let's get to those later and
talk about the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;: Bodies are different. Experiences are different. I'm
writing this to share an interesting experience I had with friends and
family, and not to provide a point of comparison, or suggest that
running a half marathon will in any way be the same for you as it was for
me. I know that disclaimers like this aren't going to cure us of
constantly measuring ourselves against each other, but it's a gentle
reminder and I hope it helps ♥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running a half marathon was surprisingly easy. I don't know how to
explain it, but Eli and I got up this morning it just happened. The
first 5-6 miles were a breeze -- it was a beautiful day, and my body
is pretty used to running this distance. Eli and I also had a lot to
talk about, since we had both had eventful weeks, so these first miles
flew by. Around mile 6.5-7 I felt myself slowing down and tiring out,
so I ate an energy gummy and instantly felt better. Not just a little
bit better, but like Super Woman better. Like, I was &lt;em&gt;fucking running&lt;/em&gt;
better. By mile 8 my legs felt tight and swollen, but definitely not
unbearably so. And in fact, this was the only real &amp;quot;pain&amp;quot; I felt. None
of my joints ached, none of my muscles hurt in that &amp;quot;This is an injury
waiting to happen&amp;quot; way. I wasn't out of breath, I didn't have a
side-ache or shoulder-ache which I typically get on long runs. Even my
lower back didn't hurt. It was strange and wonderful. We started to
count down the miles around mile 9, running down cozy neighborhood
streets to avoid cars and thinking about all the food we were going to
eat when the run was done. I kept expecting my body to hit a wall at
some point in these last 4 miles, but it just never did. By that
point, how could we &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; finish? 3 miles? 2 miles?  When you're
counting down, it seems like &amp;quot;I can run that far, no problem.&amp;quot; We
ended up having to run around the downtown area a bit for our last
mile, but then ended up smack in front of one of our favorite
Corvallis restaurants. And that was it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end it was much less of a Big Deal than I thought it would be.
That isn't to say I think I could have gone on for &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; 13.1
miles, but I hadn't really considered the possibility that it would be
something we just did and then went on with our days. I thought it
would be this big event, like there would be Pre-Half-Marathon life
and Post-Half-Marathon life, but that totally didn't happen. &lt;em&gt;I wasn't
even sore the next day&lt;/em&gt;. It was a weirdly and wonderfully
anti-climatic event. This is where the conflicting feelings come in: I
feel like I should be proud of myself and this thing I accomplished. I
feel like I should be able to relax for the rest of the weekend,
knowing that I have already done so much more than I thought I would
do. But I don't feel like I earned that pride, or relaxation. Not even
as if pride or relaxation need to be earned, but my body didn't want
to rest. I still wanted to go for walks, and write this blog post, and
&lt;em&gt;do stuff&lt;/em&gt;, and not brag to people about how I had run 13.1 miles. It
was a confusing and terrible feeling. My mind was saying &amp;quot;We ran a
half marathon! Break out the ice cream and TV, let's do nothing and
luxuriate in our glory for a few hours&amp;quot;. But my body was like &amp;quot;Nah,
let's make a smoothie and walk to the play ground&amp;quot;. Part of me is so
disappointed by this. If not after a half-marathon, when will I ever
get to rest? When will I be free of the shoulds and have-tos I live in
every day? But another part of me thinks it's cool that my body can
undergo this huge stress, and then considers &amp;quot;taking it easy&amp;quot; to be
continuing to take good care of itself. I don't know where that leaves
me. I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; proud of what I did, and I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; relax when I need to.
So...maybe it's not so bad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="context"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Context&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This part is honestly super boring, especially if you know me. It's
more to hopefully answer any questions people who stumble on this post
might have, rather than add to the story of the post. You can totally
skip it if you want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those not intimately familiar with my entire life's story, here's
some relevant context that affected (effected? Email me if you know
which one is correct) my half marathon.  I used to run long distances
in high school, but could never get past 6-7 miles. And this was at a
time I look back on as being the most fit I've ever been, when I
considered myself &amp;quot;a runner&amp;quot;.  This is all to say that I wasn't
expecting to be able to run a half marathon, having only decided to do
so 5 days before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind, this wasn't couch-to-half-marathon in 5 days. In fact,
just 6 months ago, I walked the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://portlandmarathon.org"&gt;Portland Half-Marathon&lt;/a&gt;, so I knew
that I could at least get my body through 13.1 miles. I workout
religiously 5-6 days each week, doing 30-60 minutes on the
elliptical[1] at least 4 of those days and lifting weights the other
1-2. I love to exercise, and find a lot of joy in moving my body. I
wasn't unfit or unprepared to run a half, and most importantly I know
how to listen to my body and hear when it tells me to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also am not &amp;quot;a runner&amp;quot; though. Eli and I will occasionally run in
Corvallis, since I don't have access to a gym, but as previously
mentioned this wasn't something I had been training for for weeks, or
even something I had particular investment in completing. It was just
an interesting challenge I wanted to see if I was up to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-logistics"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Logistics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.corvallishalfmarathon.com/"&gt;Corvallis Half Marathon&lt;/a&gt; had been put on just a few weeks prior,
and they had posted the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.corvallishalfmarathon.com/uploads/1/0/8/3/10830951/2017_map_for_web.jpg"&gt;course map&lt;/a&gt;. We mostly just followed that,
only starting from Eli's house and ending downtown at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.broken-yolk.com/"&gt;Broken
Yolk&lt;/a&gt; (highly recommend, if you're visiting the area).  We carried a
speaker so we could both listen to podcasts | music, each of us had
our phones (which ended up being helpful), and some energy gummies
that a lovely co-worker had given me (I believe they were the Clif
ones, and they were &lt;em&gt;lifesavers&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="things-to-do-differently-next-time"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Things to Do Differently Next Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not currently planning on running more long distances any time
soon. Then again, I got my first tattoo and thought I wouldn't get
another one for a long time if ever, only to get another much larger
one less than a year later. Here are some thing I would do different
next time though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wish I had researched and bought better running shoes. I ran in
an old pair that I got more for lifting weights than running, and
while they were sufficient for this one run I would definitely not
be able to run regularly in them. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://portlandrunningcompany.com/"&gt;Portland Running Co.&lt;/a&gt; is a
great place to get fitted for running shoes, if you're not loving
your current pair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wish we had mapped the course more accurately. We ended up need
to run our last mile around downtown Corvallis, because the route
we ran ended up being about 12.3 miles instead of 13.1. We still
did it, but it would have been nice to have that final mile not
involve so many cars, pedestrians, and intersections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wish I had a fanny pack. I treated my jacket as a fanny pack, but
it quickly got too hot and I ended up tying it around my waist.
Again, this was fine for the one run, but if I was going to run
more regularly a fanny pack would be super useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running a half marathon was just another thing we did. It wasn't quite
hard, and it definitely wasn't easy, but it's something we may or may
not do again in the future. I don't know how to end blog posts
apparently, so...have an excellent rest of your day! Stay sexy, and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://myfavoritemurder.com"&gt;don't get murdered&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

better for your joints.&lt;/p&gt;

since I was a teenager, and as my personal care routine has evolved to
suit my body's needs my dandruff has stubbornly persisted.  When I was
shampooing every day? Dandruff. When I went months without shampooing?
Dandruff.  Tea tree oil? Dandruff. Special shampoos? Dandruff. I want
to get to the root (ha) of this problem, and &lt;strong&gt;solve my itchy, flaky
scalp without destroying my precious curls&lt;/strong&gt;. Many women, myself
included, will tell you they've spent years perfecting their hair care
routine. It's a science, a long series of experiments and tweaks to
help our hair be healthy and strong.  I don't want to lose all the
progress I've made in that routine, so the challenge here is really to
&lt;strong&gt;fix the dandruff without sacrificing the health of my hair&lt;/strong&gt;.
Challenge: Accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started researching the causes of dandruff and, it turns out, there
are not 1, not 2, but 4 potential causes of dandruff (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dandruff/symptoms-causes/dxc-20215281"&gt;Mayo clinic&lt;/a&gt;).
This means that you'll have to experiment with different treatments to
find what works for you!  Ok, so let's take a look at those causes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="fungus"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fungus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EW! According to the Mayo Clinic, one cause of dandruff is &amp;quot;A
yeast-like fungus, Malassezia, which lives on the scalps of most
adults. But, for some, it irritates the scalp and can cause more skin
cells to grow. The extra skin cells die and fall off, making them
appear white and flaky in your hair or on your clothes. Why malassezia
irritates some scalps isn't known.&amp;quot; Ok, so we all have some fungus on
our heads, and allegedly this is the primary cause of dandruff for
most adults (especially if you're following a solid haircare routine
to begin with). What can we do if it's a problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="treatments"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Treatments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of natural treatments for this type of dandruff,
including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tea tree oil&lt;/strong&gt;. My SO uses &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Now-Foods-Tea-Tree-Oil/dp/B000ELP5KA"&gt;this highly concentrated kind&lt;/a&gt;, rubbing
it into his scalp after a shower about once a month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Cider Vinegar&lt;/strong&gt;. It makes your skin glow! It helps
digestion! It cures cancer! I know, I know, ACV is practically
the coconut oil of 2017. But
allegedly the acidity helps kill the fungus, and prevent it from
growing so quickly. &lt;strong&gt;Lemon juice&lt;/strong&gt; also works for this.  Mix with
equal parts water and spray onto scalp ~15-20 minutes before
showering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medicated Shampoos&lt;/strong&gt;.  You've seen them at the drug store. You're
looking for one that contains ketoconazole, selenium sulfide, or
pyrithione zinc. It's recommended you use it as often as your hair
can handle, which for me is honestly only once a week (even then,
the next day is rough).  If it
helps, awesome! If not, read on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bacteria"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bacteria&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to 2016 study published in Nature, bacteria (mainly
Propionibacterium and Staphylococcus) can contribute more to dandruff
than Malassezia (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep24877"&gt;Study&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="id1"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Treatments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="dry-scalp"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dry Scalp&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms here are small, less-oily white flakes with no redness or
inflammation. It's especially likely that this if your culprit if you're prone to dry skin on
other parts of you as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="id2"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Treatments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="irritated-oily-skin"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Irritated, Oily Skin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AKA seborrheic dermatitis.  According to Mayo Clinic, this is the most
common cause of dandruff, though I'm skeptical of this. The symptoms
include red, irritated, greasy skin covered by flaky white or yellow
scales, and is often found on other hairy parts of the body, not just
your scalp (think: eyebrows).  In other words, you would &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; if you
had this, and would definitely want to do something about it. Hence,
skepticism. But if you take a close look at your scalp in the mirror
and do notice redness or greasiness, this could be what's causing your
dandruff!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="id3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Treatments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is worth seeing your doctor for, and following what they
prescribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="buildup"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Buildup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just when you don't shampoo enough, so dead skin cells and
oils build up then flake off. Honestly, when I
was only shampooing once a month, I didn't notice my dandruff get
better or worse. I'm guessing, if you're reading this, that this isn't
your issue. But it is a common cause of dandruff for the
less-than-tidy among us, and knowledge worth having in your back
pocket for all those times friends ask you for advice on getting rid
of dandruff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="id4"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Treatments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Literally just shampoo more. Any shampoo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bad-reaction-to-products"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bad Reaction to Products&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect this is kind of rare, and once again that you would know if
you had this, but many hair products contain harsh chemicals that your
skin may be reacting to. If you think this might be the case, or
haven't used a new shampoo in a while, I especially like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drbronner.com/"&gt;Dr.Bronner&lt;/a&gt;
products for natural soaps and shampoos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="general-treatments"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;General Treatments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few things you can do to keep your body healthy, and
prevent some dandruff in the process. These are all things you already
know you should be doing, but if dandruff is really the kick in the
pants you need to change some habits then do it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get enough sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink enough water&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a balanced diet&lt;/strong&gt;, including lots of &lt;strong&gt;fruits and vegetables&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-worked-for-me"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Worked for Me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whew! Ok, so a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of things could be causing dandruff. I was pretty
sure that my dandruff wasn't being caused by buildup or a reaction to
any products I was using, and was relatively sure that it wasn't dry
scalp (since my scalp was still oily). The Fungus seemed like the most
likely culprit based on my symptoms and the fact that it's so common,
and since I like using natural products I gave tea tree oil a shot
first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used 100% tea tree oil, and would just dab it on my scalp 1-2 times
each week, and rub it in. This helped a little bit, but not as much as
I had hoped. It was also relatively expensive, especially for how much
oil I had to use for each use. This was definitely a &amp;quot;There must be a
better way!&amp;quot; situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I tried using baking soda as a scalp scrubber. I would use about
2 tbsp of it in the shower, scrubbing my scalp for a minute or two
then rinsing it out. This wasn't a &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; solution, but it was
definitely kind of messy and left my hair feeling a little dry. On the
plus side, though, I discovered that it does make a great (occasional)
face scrub, which I used about once every 2 weeks or when my face is
feeling especially bumpy or oily. So not bad, but not great either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step was to try a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Cosmetics-Dandruff-Shampoo-Rosemary/dp/B000FGDIAS"&gt;natural anti-dandruff shampoo&lt;/a&gt;. I've
always been wary of using shampoo, since curly hair tends to do better
with minimal shampooing and doesn't hold up well to harsh chemicals
and lathering agents common in shampoos (sodium laureth sulfate is
basically my hair's worst nightmare). But I found a shampoo that
didn't have any of the harsh chemicals I had been conditioned to
avoid, was reasonably priced, and had tea tree oil as it's main
anti-dandruff combatant.  Coincidentally at the same time, I decided
to get a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Shampoo-Scalp-Massage-Brush-Century/dp/B0028R4SRO"&gt;scalp scrubber&lt;/a&gt; similar to one my boyfriend uses, which
turned out to be &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; useful. I use the shampoo 2x/week, and use
the scalp scrubber to lather it and make sure that I get it over all
of my scalp. &lt;strong&gt;This was the solution I had been waiting for!&lt;/strong&gt;  My
hair didn't dry out (and, in fact, I got a new conditioner that makes
it super soft and lovely), and my dandruff was &lt;em&gt;gone&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;strong&gt;Gone gone&lt;/strong&gt;.
No more itching, no more flakes everywhere, no more oily finger and
gross keyboard. I cannot overstate what a miracle these 2 products
have been for me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, it was just a matter of trying different things that fit
my lifestyle and needs until I found a solution that works. Regardless
of what's causing your dandruff or if you even have dandruff, I highly
recommend getting a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Shampoo-Scalp-Massage-Brush-Century/dp/B0028R4SRO"&gt;scalp scrubber&lt;/a&gt; (the one linked works for me,
but shop around for one that works for you!). It helps circulate blood
to your scalp, and I've noticed significant improvement in the volume
and health of my hair as well as my scalp since using it (your mileage
may vary). But for $8 you may as well, right? Then, looking into a
natural anti-dandruff shampoo, most likely with tea tree oil, is
another good step if you're looking for things to try. I like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Cosmetics-Dandruff-Shampoo-Rosemary/dp/B000FGDIAS"&gt;this
one&lt;/a&gt;, but again find something that works for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's it folks! I hope this helps you in your own hair and
dandruff journey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

be the best book I read this year. The military has never been a part
of the cultures I grew up in, so my knowledge and awareness of
what the military is, how it's run, and what it does is basically
nothing. I couldn't even tell you all of the branches, or the
distinctions between them. With this context in mind, this book held
incredible insight for me. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rosabrooks.com/"&gt;Rosa Brooks&lt;/a&gt;, a former reporter for the
Pentagon, explains not only what the military does but why it does it,
how it does it, what impacts those actions have. She's able to support
her claims with ample evidence as well as personal stories, and
defends her statements and positions from every possible angle. She
also looks at various parts of the military under a microscope,
explaining the history of this unit or that organization and where
they are today, and also looks very broadly at the military as a whole
complex system and how that system is working. She asks questions like
&amp;quot;What does it mean to be a solider, both historically and today? How
has that role changed in the last 2000 years and in the last decade?&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;Why is our military a proxy for diplomacy, nation building, and
relief effort?&amp;quot;. She explores the relationship between soldiers and
civilians, and how that too has changed dramatically over time.
I came away from the book with a greater
understanding of our military's history, it's present state, and how
it came to be the way that it is. I know more about what the military
does and why it does it, and the pros and cons of having the military
partake in all of the actions that it does.&lt;/p&gt;

daughters married to a man of means. What I loved about Eligible was
that the author stayed very true to the characters while modernizing
them seamlessly. Jane is sensible and pragmatic, Mrs.Bennet is
exasperated and a little manipulative, Lydia and Kitty are thick as
thieves and a little wild, and Mary is awkward and unaware. Avid P&amp;amp;P
fans (ahem, Mackenzie Broderick) may hold a more critical eye to the
novel, but a pleb like me who has only read P&amp;amp;P twice will no doubt
enjoy the classic tale of women, ambitions, and marriage, told in a
modern setting.&lt;/p&gt;

they came to flip houses, and how they got to be on TV. Their story is
sweet and heartfelt, and it's clear that they had to &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; to get to

my mind off my SO's departure I listened to Jessi Klein's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27170141-you-ll-grow-out-of-it"&gt;You'll Grow
Out of It&lt;/a&gt;. I had seen this book splashed across the Powell's 'New +
Recommended' lists, in the hands and Instagram accounts of
celebrities, and even had it on personal recommendation from a friend.
And it could not have come at a better time. Jessi's book is all about
coming of age, but instead of focusing on adolescence she focuses on
her twenties and thirties. From terrible boyfriends, to better
boyfriends, to a fiancee, and finally to her pregnancy and child
rearing, Klein's book was a laugh and a comfort when I needed it most.
As comfortable as my situation is now, thinking about the future
&lt;em&gt;terrifies&lt;/em&gt; me. How am I going to have kids &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a career? Do I even
want kids? Do I even want a career? Do I want &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; career? What if
things don't work out with my current SO? What if I can't get
pregnant? Or worse, what if I &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; get pregnant? Oh god oh god oh
god oh god oh god oh god. I know I'm not alone, that my millennial
peers are worrying the same worries and fearing the same futures. But
it's still so profoundly comforting to hear the journey of someone you
admire. That the best laid plans often go astray, and that &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;
planning can work itself out. That &lt;strong&gt;you will be OK&lt;/strong&gt; because Jessi
was OK and she doesn't have this any more figured out than you do.
I highly highly highly recommend this book. It will be a friend to
you, no matter where you are or where you see your life going. It will
get you through those dark January days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 The bright side (ha) is that, because I get into the office before
sunrise and leave after sunset, I don't need to wear sunscreen. Score.&lt;/p&gt;

days ago I was buying my last physics textbook, working on my senior
project, and applying to jobs in my spare time. I had never voted in a
Presidential election[1]. I had never ordered a drink at a bar. I had
never left the US. I had never celebrated a 1 year anniversary with an
SO. Though most of us lovingly refer to 2016 as the Year of the
Dumpster Fire, my life got &lt;em&gt;so much better&lt;/em&gt;
over the course of 2016. I &lt;em&gt;graduated&lt;/em&gt;. I can go to 21+ concerts now,
and spend all my money on wine (woops). I got to visit 3 beautiful
countries and experience their culture. And I started working at a
company I love with people who are smarter and kinder than I am, doing
work that not only interests me but lets me to grow and learn
everyday[2]. I don't have any great point to make, or words of wisdom
as we hurtle inevitably into the future. But thinking about the last
year, I can't help but be filled with gratitude. I'm grateful to be
surrounded by family and community who love me, grateful for the
opportunities I've been given, grateful that I am ok and that the
people I love are ok, grateful that I am constantly given chances to
be a better human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be perfectly honest, I'm not excited about 2017. My SO has to go
back to university soon, and leave me sleeping alone again. We have a
long and melancholy winter stretched before us, with short gray days
and long cold nights as far as the eye can see. There are no fun trips
planned, no graduations, no 21st birthdays, no weddings, no reunions.
The thought of the next few months only makes me feel hollow.
But...but there should a but here. But there is no but. It just is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] And had never been devastated by the results of an election
[2] For example, today I learned that some people don't think it's
necessary to pin dependency versions. And that I do not like those
people&lt;/p&gt;

and are looking forward to some quality time with the people you love
in the coming weeks. Before the madness really started Eli and I got
to spend a week in San Francisco while he visited &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://coreos.com/"&gt;CoreOS&lt;/a&gt;, the tech
startup he interned for this Fall. They were nice enough to get an
AirBnB big enough for the two of us, so I tagged along and took the
week off to explore the city! This post is one part tourists guide to
San Francisco, one part meditations on Silicon Valley, and one part
processing the trip and telling loved ones about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll admit: before this trip the
prospect of working in Silicon Valley felt dire. Anywhere but there!
I thought every engineer would be working 80 hours weeks, a bunch of
20-somethings with nothing better to do than program all day and prove
they were smarter than &lt;em&gt;everyone ever&lt;/em&gt; including me.  I thought of the
Bay as soulless and scrappy, the very definition of rat-race.  And I
wanted no part in it. With some pretty dramatic notions, I came into
this trip like I was interviewing the city to see if I could work
there some day. The beating heart of my industry is there, and to rule
it out completely would be to rule out working for some really great
organizations. I wanted to see if I was justified in categorically
refusing to work in San Francisco, or if I should give it a chance.
I'm happy to report that by the end of the week, San Francisco had won
me over!  Here's how it happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-i-did"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I Did&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Eli spent most of each day working, I had the hours and city to
myself. We were staying in the lower Mission district, so I spent most
of my time walking from there to some of the famous sights and
neighborhoods of San Francisco. There's no better way to get a feel
for a city than just walking through it. I also got to spend the
evenings with Eli's coworkers, talking about CoreOS, school, and
living in the Bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-i-loved"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I Loved&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did on my first day in the city was venture to the
top of the &lt;strong&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/strong&gt;, a hill in the middle of San Francisco that
offers an incredible 360° view of the city. The (walk|climb) was short
but pretty, much of it through parks and sleepy neighborhoods, and the
view from the top was breathtaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, I visited the &lt;strong&gt;San Francisco Botanical Garden&lt;/strong&gt; and
&lt;strong&gt;Japanese Garden&lt;/strong&gt;, in Golden Gate Park.  Honestly, I expected Golden
Gate Park to be this thriving, humming center, similar to Central Park
in New York.  I thought it would be filled with people enjoying
nature, wandering around, sitting on benches and watching life go by.
Instead, it was pretty empty.  But I can tell the city has invested a
lot of money in cleaning it up, and trying to turn it into a Central
Park for San Francisco. The lawns are beautiful, there are tons of
paths and benches and fountains, and there's a lot to see! Even in the
dead of winter, the Botanical Gardens and Japanese Gardens were
beautiful.  Well curated, inviting, and expansive, they were the kind
of places you could get lost in.  It made me miss Forest Park in
Portland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later, I found myself wandering through the &lt;strong&gt;Financial
District&lt;/strong&gt;. Specifically the areas just north and south of Market
street, I found &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt; historic buildings, the kind with lots of
brick and exposed concrete interiors. Filled with fancy shops and
offices and decorated with Christmas lights, these neighborhoods were
absolutely magical, and the reason I fell for the city. I could see
myself walking up and down these streets each weekend, enjoying the
luxury and beauty around me for hours. This was by far my favorite
thing to see, so much so that I went back 2 more times.  Highly,
highly recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearby, I also enjoyed visiting &lt;strong&gt;Union Square&lt;/strong&gt;.  It was totally
packed and crazy, but it was also a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; place to just sit and
people watch. If you're at all into bustling city centers, this is
definitely the place to be!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I enjoyed &lt;strong&gt;the Marina&lt;/strong&gt;, between Ghirardelli Square and the Golden
Gate Bridge. It's a beautiful stretch of beaches and parks, with
beautiful views and nice walkways. If you're visiting either of those
land marks, definitely take the extra half hour to walk along the
beach for a bit. You won't be sorry!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-i-should-have-skipped"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I Should Have Skipped&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fisherman's Wharf&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Pier 39&lt;/strong&gt; were very touristy and
uninteresting, filled with cheap knick-knack shops and nothing unique
or distinctly San Francisco. Unless you're craving some In n' Out,
you're better off spending you're time elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haight-Ashbury&lt;/strong&gt; was boring at best, unsafe at worst. I thought it
would be like the beloved Hawthorne street in Portland, full of
cute and eclectic local shops, but ended up treading on used needles
as I walked past smoke shop after smoke shop. When I saw one of the
many idle young men along the street pull out a large knife to show to
his friend, I veered onto a side street and decided there were better
things to see in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my last day exploring the city I finally made it up to the &lt;strong&gt;Golden
Gate Bridge&lt;/strong&gt;. The American icon! The Gate to the West! Don't get me
wrong, the bridge is beautiful.  I highly recommend &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt; it.  My
mistake was walking across it.  It's incredibly loud and windy (like,
might blow you over windy), with huge trucks and buses rushing by just
inches away. The bridge is far above the water, and the railing that stands between you
and certain death is not nearly high enough to actually make you feel
safe.  There are lots of people and &lt;em&gt;kids&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;bicyclists&lt;/em&gt; going all
directions that only add to the chaos and disorientation. Really, it
feels like Australia: everything is trying to kill you, one way or
another. It's also &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; -- it took me ~40 minutes to get all the way
across, including 2 long stops at the pillars to take some deep
breaths and text Eli my last will and testament. So drive across. Or
just don't cross it at all. There's nothing on the other side, &lt;em&gt;trust
me&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, San Francisco proved itself to have more character and
coziness than we expected. I loved exploring the city, and
unexpectedly found that I could see myself living there for a few
years, working a fancy schmancy tech job in the city. We aren't making
any plans yet, and who knows what the future holds for us, but it
turns out it might actually be San Francisco.  Who's to say?  I'm
never certain of how to end these posts, but thanks for reading, and
have a lovely day!&lt;/p&gt;

done in the style of the Choose Your Own Adventure books, I listened
to the book on tape where flipping to page 129 wasn't exactly feasible
:p . The author himself narrates it though, and did his best to take
us through the book from start to finish without getting lost along
the way. NPH's past, from aspiring adolescent actor to young stardom
to proud husband and parent, is an interesting story told with classic
NPH humor. I can't say it was my favorite autobiography, as it
definitely erred on the side of trying too hard to be funny rather
than genuine or meaningful. But, walking the streets of San Francisco,
this book definitely held my interested and brightened my days. It was
entertaining, but didn't leave me feeling like I had insight into who
NPH was as a person at all. I will say, though, that listening to him
talk (or read aloud) about his kids was &lt;em&gt;heart melting&lt;/em&gt;.  I had no
idea what the experiences of being a &amp;quot;closeted&amp;quot; gay celebrity or a gay couple trying to
have kids were, and hearing about those first-hand was super
interesting. Definitely a tiny drop of knowledge from a world I know
little or nothing about, which is always excellent!  Overall, I
definitely recommend this book if you're looking for something light,
that doesn't require too much attention, or love all things NPH.&lt;/p&gt;

it's way to my 'New + Recommended' list any time soon. The book
follows Eleanor through a particularly whirl-wind day, from her son
Timby feigning illness to her husband becoming an unexpected
Christian. It was charming and short, definitely a decent mindless
read to have on as background noise. Though the main character,
Eleanor, was entertaining I didn't find that I connected with her very
much, or particularly cared what happened to her. That's more on me
than the novel -- she's a nuanced and well-formed character, a mildly
neurotic housewife doing her best amid the mess that is Life, who I
think a lot of people &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; resonate with.  I just didn't. But beyond
that, the book was honestly boring. Boring books aren't always bad,
they can keep you company and fill the space between more grandiose
cousins. But at the end of the day there's nothing memorable, lasting,
or insightful about the book. If you're looking for something to pick
up this isn't the first thing I'd recommend, but it's not the worst
choice either.  It's the 'meh' choice.&lt;/p&gt;

think. 'It Ends With Us' follows Lily Bloom as she opens her own
flower shop and falls in love with a surgeon, Ryle Kincaid. With a
history of abuse in the family and vivid memories of her mother
covered in bruises and cuts, Lily knows too well the cycle of violence
and apology that so many abusive men exhibit. But when her
relationship with Ryle takes increasingly dark turns, she denies that
anything is wrong. At first they seem like such small incidents --
things that could happen to anybody. We all lose our tempers, or lash
out when we don't mean to. But as Ryle becomes her husband, and then
the father of her child, his violence escalates. With her own daughter
on the way, she's faced with a choice: be just like her mother, or
leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'It Ends With Us' was deeply personal for Colleen Hoover, and that shines
through in the novel. The characters are rich and sympathetic, and
they show the nuance and shades of grey in an abusive relationship.
It's easy to look in from the outside and judge victims of abuse for
staying. How can they not see what's happening to them? How can they
live each day with people who hit them, or scream at them? 'It Ends
With Us' helped me understand how those relationships are like frogs
in hot water, how abusive husbands can have a lot of good qualities
and think they are good people (though make no mistake, they are
&lt;em&gt;monsters&lt;/em&gt;), and how it can be easy to explain away incidents of
abuse. I won't spoil anything, but I will say that there's also a very
happy ending, which was well worth sticking around for!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was deeply touched by 'It Ends With Us', and came away not only with
another good love story in my ears but with a deeper understanding of
what victims of abuse go through. The mark of a great book is one that
not only entertains and rivets, but that changes the way you move
through everyday life and see the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've spent far, far too much of my life thinking about my body.  Is it
thin enough, pretty enough, good enough? As if that's any reflection
of me as a person. But for all of that obsession I rarely took time
to appreciate all of the things my body is capable of, and how
&lt;em&gt;valuable&lt;/em&gt; my health is. It requires a lot of maintenance (was 8
hours of sleep really necessary, evolution?), but having a healthy
body lets me focus on living and experiencing and enjoying.  I can
spend hours hiking, eat most foods, and take care of myself entirely
on my own. I don't need to take a pill in the morning, or worry about
whether a restaurant will have something that's safe for me to eat.
And I'm able-bodied, a privilege I take entirely for granted which
influences how others see and treat me. My body
is the vessel I live in, my home, my rock, and it's been a damn good
one at that. For that, I'm grateful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this isn't usually the first (or third) thing folks think of
when considering things they're grateful for, but there are many
aspects of my work that fill me with appreciation and joy. I have the
privilege of doing work that I love, that is challenging, interesting,
and fulfilling, where I get to spend my days learning, creating, and
solving complex problems. What's more I get to do all of this with
people who are smarter and kinder than I am, constantly inspiring me
to grow and be a better human. I work with people I look forward to
seeing, who &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/respect.html"&gt;respect and care for me&lt;/a&gt;, who &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; me and who I can be
myself around. I definitely never expected my workplace to be the
first place I went after a national tragedy, and expected even less to
be consoled and comforted by my coworkers. Leaving work that day was
the moment I knew I was in the right place. The cherry on top is that
I work at a company that values my contributions, that makes me feel
welcome, and that works hard to make sure I'm appropriately
compensated for my work.  And my commute is a 30 minute walk! There's
no where else I'd rather spend most of my waking hours, that's for
sure.&lt;/p&gt;

with them at lunch when no one else would. They intervened when I was
dating someone who wasn't nice to me. They shared their crayons with
me, went to summer camps with me, spent countless christmases and

the things I'm grateful for. Now, more than ever, I think we all need
to take some time to appreciate what is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; in the world and remind
friends and family that &lt;em&gt;they are loved&lt;/em&gt;. Remind ourselves that &lt;em&gt;we
are loved&lt;/em&gt;. That our lives are so full, and that we have so much to
give to others. In an effort to spiritually recharge and fully
appreciate how &lt;em&gt;lucky&lt;/em&gt; I am, I plan to write a post each day leading
up to Thanksgiving on something I'm grateful for. This exercise is
definitely something I need in my life right now, to focus on my
values and what's important to me.  As a fair warning I know posts
about how great my life is can come off as boastful, or
holier-than-thou, and I want to emphasize that's not what I intend. Acknowledging what a privileged life I lead is meant to make me
aware of the complex factors that give me that privilege, and help me
work to afford that privilege to &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;. Knowing that &lt;em&gt;I did not
get here on my own&lt;/em&gt; helps me internalize that society is not an equal
playing field, and that &amp;quot;success&amp;quot; is less a measure of character than
of advantage. Alright, enough preaching, let's get to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's topic is the obvious choice: &lt;strong&gt;Family&lt;/strong&gt;. Beyond literally
giving me life, my parents have supported me in every endeavor I've
undertaken, and provided me endless opportunities to learn, grow, and
achieve my goals. They provided for me, so I never had to go to school
hungry or wonder where I would sleep at night. They are loving, so I
never doubt for a second that they are proud of me, or love me, or
will be there for me &lt;em&gt;no matter what&lt;/em&gt;. They are kind, thoughtful, good
people, who have dedicated their lives to making their little corner
of the world a better place. I'm grateful to have a brother I could
share my childhood with, who initially challenged me to not hit back
and now challenges me to think critically and objectively.  It's so
much easier to move through the world knowing that if anything
happened I have people I can ask for help, for advice, for
understanding, for forgiveness, and they would give it
unconditionally. For that, I'm grateful.&lt;/p&gt;

next four years could impact my life and lives of those I love.  And
after Tuesday night, I was left wondering &lt;em&gt;what can I do?&lt;/em&gt;  It's easy
to feel powerless, and hopeless.  To join a facebook group or go to a
protest, because that feels like the only thing there is to do to
express your grief, your rage, your heart sickness. But there are more
concrete steps you can take to fight for what is good in this world.
And &lt;strong&gt;there is still good&lt;/strong&gt;. There are many organizations and
individuals fighting for what we believe in, and more than anything
what we can do now is &lt;strong&gt;stand together with them&lt;/strong&gt;.  That's how we can
create the changes we want to see in our nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who are these organizations? What are they doing? How can you support
them?  Here are some short lists of fantastic groups of people, and
how they need your help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="volunteer"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Volunteer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to support an organization is by giving your
time and energy towards their cause.  &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.volunteermatch.org/search/orgs.jsp"&gt;Volunteermatch.com&lt;/a&gt; is a great
resource for finding opportunities near you that align with causes you
are most passionate about. This list is specific to Portland, OR,
though these organizations have many chapters across the US and
similar groups in many cities. You can also &lt;strong&gt;donate&lt;/strong&gt; to many of
these organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.basicrights.org/get-involved/volunteer/"&gt;Basic Rights Oregon&lt;/a&gt; works to protect the rights of marginalized
groups across Oregon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.projectaccessnow.org/"&gt;Project Access Now&lt;/a&gt; has volunteer positions for people of all
skills, from community members to healthcare providers, that allow
you to help underprivileged people get the healthcare they need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.forestparkconservancy.org/"&gt;Park Conservancy&lt;/a&gt; to preserve and maintain parks in your city&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://friendsoftrees.org/"&gt;Friends of Trees&lt;/a&gt; plants trees!  No experience necessary to
volunteer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="donate"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Donate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the means, there are a number of organizations fighting
the good fight who need funds for equipment, legal fees, travel,
paying organizers, and various other necessities to keep their doors
open and continue to change the world for the better. Here are some
awesome organizations that especially need your support now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/"&gt;Planned Parenthood&lt;/a&gt; provides reproductive healthcare to women
across the US that is affordable and safe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://action.aclu.org/secure/protect-rights-freedoms-we-believe-6?s_src=UNV160001HERO&amp;amp;ms=web_hero"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)&lt;/a&gt; aims &amp;quot;To maintain
and advance civil liberties, including, without limitation, the
freedoms of association, press, religion, and speech, and the rights
to the franchise, to due process of law, and to equal protection of
the laws for all people throughout the United States and its
jurisdictions.&amp;quot; And they're gearing up to see Donald Trump in court.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.naacp.org/"&gt;NAACP&lt;/a&gt;. Their website says it best: &amp;quot;The mission of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)
is to ensure the political, educational, social, and economic
equality of rights of all persons and to eliminate race-based
discrimination.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.childrenshealthfund.org/"&gt;Children's Health Fund&lt;/a&gt; provides healthcare to the nations
most underserved children, reducing the impact of the healthcare
crises on those most vulnerable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thetrevorproject.org/"&gt;Trevor Project&lt;/a&gt; has a very simple mission: end suicide among
LGBTQ+ people, especially young folks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://csgv.org/"&gt;Coalition to Stop Gun Violence&lt;/a&gt; is comprised of 47 national
organizations working to advance gun control and end gun violence in
America&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: I'm having trouble finding reliable pro-immigration
organizations or advocacy groups. If you know of any that you support
please email me at &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:wyman.lucy&amp;#64;gmail.com"&gt;wyman.lucy&amp;#64;gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="empower"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Empower&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the people we are capable of impacting most are those
closest to us. I know &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of you reading this already support your
sons, daughters, siblings, parents, friends, students, and coworkers. You
encourage them to do what they love, to create the world they want to
live in, to reach for their dreams, and be kind to others. The ripple
effects of that empowerment are what create the society we live in,
and that is by far the most &lt;strong&gt;impactful&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;positive&lt;/strong&gt; thing you can
do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also read more about &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://codeascraft.com/2016/10/19/being-an-effective-ally-to-women-and-non-binary-people/"&gt;being an effective ally&lt;/a&gt; to
marginalized groups (the article is specific to women and non-binary
folks, but I find the principles apply to most groups).  That article
has been a guiding light to me in the past months, and has helped me
be aware of my actions and how I can help others with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know you've seen all the same positive quotes and inspirational text
I have.  I won't echo much of that here, but will say you are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;
powerless.  Even if your action is as simple as talking to your loved
ones about what has happened, and what you can do for them in their
times of need, you are fighting the prejudice and hatred reflected in
our laws and policies. I'll leave you with the quote that brought us
all to tears: &amp;quot;Please never stop believing that fighting for
what’s right is worth it. It is, it is worth it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

this every year: it's always too early to start thinking about the
holidays until December 20th, and then I'm scrambling to find or make
good gifts for my family and friends. I don't know about you, but I do
&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; work best under that kind of pressure. I also don't have the
foresight to do what my mom does and just shop for presents
year-round, finding things she thinks people will like. We can't all
be planners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, November 4th seems like a good enough in between. And what better
gift is there to give than a good story?  Whether your
recipient is an enthusiastic reader or hasn't picked up a book in
years, I think there's something for everyone at the local book store.
Here are my recommendations, no matter who you're giving to!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="for-the-non-reader"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For the Non-Reader&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is definitely the hardest person to buy a book for. But with
the rise of audiobooks, coloring books, and graphic novels
I think you can find something for everyone! Let's break it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="audiobooks"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Audiobooks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't overstate how much I love audiobooks. I spend so much time
walking, running, doing laundry, cooking, stretching, &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt;, and
being able to spend that time with a book in my ears has been
life changing. I use &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://app.overdrive.com/"&gt;Overdrive&lt;/a&gt; (way better than Audible!), which
connects to your local library and lets you download e-books and
audiobooks to any device, including &lt;em&gt;your phone&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;For free&lt;/strong&gt;.
Fancy, right? Here's how you can turn that into a non-reader gift:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set it up&lt;/strong&gt;. Installing the app, connecting it to the library,
downloading books, connecting the phone to the
car...it can be a lot. Getting everything ready to go so your loved
one just has to press 'play' could be the push they need to remember
how much they love books!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CDs&lt;/strong&gt;. I know I know I know. But again, sometimes setting it all
up on the phone is just too much.  Give your loved one a book on
tape they can play in the car. Especially perfect if you've got an
upcoming road trip!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your own recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;. Sharing a book together is a beautiful
thing. Seeing a novel through someone else's eyes can open up new
perspectives, interpretations, and meaning you may not have seen.
And you get to share a thing you love with a person you love.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="coloring-books"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Coloring Books&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've seen them.  You've thought &amp;quot;Really? Adult coloring books?&amp;quot;.
Your friend's mom has one. And now, your mom can have one too!
Coloring is meditative, methodic, excellent to keep your hands busy
while watching TV.  Here are a few that look neat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.powells.com/book/secret-garden-an-inky-treasure-hunt-coloring-book-9781780671062/1-20"&gt;The Secret Garden&lt;/a&gt;. Kind of the OG coloring book.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.powells.com/book/pride-prejudice-a-coloring-classic-9781524701123/1-1"&gt;Pride and Prejudice: A Coloring Classic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find more of them &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.powells.com/books/childrens/activities/coloring-books"&gt;at Powell's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="graphic-novels"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Graphic Novels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just for kids! Graphic novels have grown into beautifully
illustrated, intricate stories with as much character development,
plot, and meaning as any other book.  Here are a few that are really
stunning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25179.Blankets"&gt;Blankets&lt;/a&gt; by Craig Thompson. This was definitely the first graphic
novel I read where I realized what a graphic novel could be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22040598-the-sculptor"&gt;The Sculptor&lt;/a&gt; by Scott McCloud. Per the recommendation of my SO, a
graphic novel fan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="for-the-history-buff"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For the History Buff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27209433-white-trash"&gt;White Trash: The 400-Year Untold History of Class in America&lt;/a&gt; by
Nancy Isenberg. America is hardly classless,
anybody-can-be-anything country  we like to think it is. This book
recounts the history of the mistreatment of the poor, and discusses
the surprising origins of elitism in the US (hint: owning land used
to be a BFD).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077874-hrc"&gt;HRC&lt;/a&gt; by Amie Parnes and Jonathan Allen. You may as well start
reading up on the life and times of our future president ;) It
focuses on her time as Secretary of State, but I think it has great
insight into how she makes decisions, what motivates her, and is
relatively objective and accurate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="for-the-girl-boss"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For the Girl Boss&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far the hardest category to narrow down, it's hard to go wrong with
any of these titles for the feminist reader (woops, sorry, I
misspelled 'everyone') in your life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33257571-too-fat-too-slutty-too-loud"&gt;Too Fat, Too Slutty, Too Loud&lt;/a&gt; by Anne Helen Petersen. I expected
this to be a ranty read about how women are oppressed, and instead
got some of the best essays I've ever read. This book describes how
women are scrutinized and judged by examining 9 famous women who are
too-something: too strong, too pregnant, too old, too shrill. A
great read!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29340182-shrill"&gt;Shrill&lt;/a&gt; by Lindy West. So many 'aha' moments in this book.
Lindy West names and confronts some uncomfortable truths in this
book.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll become a better human.
Really you should just get it for yourself as a present.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29405093-the-girl-with-the-lower-back-tattoo"&gt;The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo&lt;/a&gt; by Amy Schumer. An incredibly
intimate look into who Amy Schumer is, and how she came to be the
person she is today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12262741-wild"&gt;Wild&lt;/a&gt; by Cheryl Strayed. I know this book was trendier last year,
but if your loved one didn't get a chance to read it it's well worth
coming back to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17851885-i-am-malala"&gt;I am Malala&lt;/a&gt; by Malala Yousafzai. If you're not sure who she is,
you &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; need to read this.  If you know her, you know why
you need to read this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20910157-yes-please"&gt;Yes, Please&lt;/a&gt; by Amy Pohler. The life and times of an amazing
woman, featuring some great advice we could all use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="for-the-mathlete"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For the Mathlete&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are ordered by difficulty + level of math, from most advanced to
most accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24113.G_del_Escher_Bach"&gt;Gödel, Escher, Bach&lt;/a&gt; by Douglas Hofstadter is a mind-bending, brain-exploding math +
philosophy book. This is perfect your friend who just started grad
school.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17290683-love-and-math"&gt;Love and Math&lt;/a&gt; by Edward Frenkel is just a great math book.  Part memoir, part
linear algebra, Edward Frenkel discusses how he came to love math,
what he endured to be part of the mathematics community, and what he
spent his life researching and discovering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693884-how-not-to-be-wrong"&gt;How Not to Be Wrong&lt;/a&gt; by Jordan Ellenberg is for the armchair mathematician. It's a
critical analysis of how we approach problems, and common data
analytics methods.  More &amp;quot;How to think about this real-world issue&amp;quot; than
&amp;quot;Here's how Andrew Wiles solved the Fermat Theorem&amp;quot;.  My favorite
quote is:
&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;And you can't deny that there are aspects of the natural
world - I'm thinking pandas here - that seem more likely to have
resulted from grudging bureaucratic compromise than from the mind of
an all knowing deity with total creative control&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="for-the-csi-fan"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For the CSI Fan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've unexpectedly started reading mysteries recently. I
didn't even know what I was getting myself into, but here are a few
juicy ones I've enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Big Little Lies&lt;/cite&gt; by Liane Moriarty. I'm sure that every
self-respecting mystery reader has already read through Liane
Moriarty's entire catalog. BUT IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO HASN'T, do
them a favor and get them this book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27274343-i-m-thinking-of-ending-things"&gt;I'm Thinking of Ending Things&lt;/a&gt; by Iain Reid. A short but
satisfying thriller.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26114146-all-is-not-forgotten"&gt;All is Not Forgotten&lt;/a&gt; by Wendy Walker. As a mystery noob, I'm &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt;
invested in this book. Is it the son?  The pot dealer? I was hooked,
and so satisfied by the ending.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22557272-the-girl-on-the-train"&gt;The Girl on the Train&lt;/a&gt; by Paula Hawkins. Honestly, when I first read it I
thought it was a little meh. I had a hard time connecting to the
main character, or caring about what happened to her. But with all
the hype + the movie, I may have to give it another read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="for-the-friend-with-a-bb8-pillow"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For the Friend with a BB8 Pillow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AKA Sci-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/375802.Ender_s_Game"&gt;Ender's Game&lt;/a&gt; by Orson Scott Card is a classic sci-fi read that
lives up to it's legendary status.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9969571-ready-player-one"&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/a&gt; by Ernest Cline is a totally accessible and fun
story. It's a classic hero's tale, with 80's geek and gamer culture
mixed in. Highly recommend for readers of any age.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12007.Use_of_Weapons"&gt;Use of Weapons&lt;/a&gt; by Iain Banks is by far my favorite sci-fi book.
Great characters, an excellent ending, compelling plot, and very
interesting premise. Highly, highly recommend for all readers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59924.The_Lathe_of_Heaven"&gt;The Lathe of Heaven&lt;/a&gt; by Ursula K. LeGuin is a solid, satisfying
sci-fi adventure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="for-the-people-person"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For the People Person&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section is really just an excuse to recommend &lt;a class="reference internal" href="#when-breath-becomes-air"&gt;When Breath
Becomes Air&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="#when-breath-becomes-air"&gt;When Breath Becomes Air&lt;/a&gt; by Paul Kalanathi is the heartbreaking
story of a young neurosurgeon diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer.
Intimate with the American healthcare system as both a doctor and a
patient, this book has fascinating insights and thoughts around the
ultimate question: &lt;em&gt;What makes life worth living?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="#the-audacity-of-hope"&gt;The Audacity of Hope&lt;/a&gt; by Barack Obama, for when you need to
revitalize your faith in our country's politicians.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="the-audacity-of-hope"&gt;&lt;span id="when-breath-becomes-air"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;And that's all she wrote, folks! I hope you have a wonderful holiday
season, surrounded by family and friends you love ♥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's no secret that there's an &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#developer-profile-gender"&gt;incredible shortage&lt;/a&gt; of women in the
tech industry, and even less of a secret that &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/boy.html"&gt;women are treated

at my company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's no secret that there's an &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#developer-profile-gender"&gt;incredible shortage&lt;/a&gt; of women in the
tech industry, and even less of a secret that &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/boy.html"&gt;women are treated
differently than men&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in tech. This discrimination manifests itself in a lot of
ways, but for the most part it comes down to a single fact: &lt;strong&gt;we think
it's ok to disrespect women&lt;/strong&gt;.  Often times this is completely
subconscious, which doesn't absolve us of responsibility but does
point out how deeply ingrained in us sexism is. I, too, am guilty of
assuming my friend's pronoun-less colleague is a &amp;quot;he&amp;quot;, and assuming
Bob knows what he's talking about but Alice doesn't¹.  So when I
recently took a job at my company, I unconsciously expected some of
this bias to color my daily interactions. I didn't even think about
it; of course it was something I would have to deal with. I was a lady
programmer at the bottom of the corporate totem pole. Why should men
with 20+ years of experience in the field listen to me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against all of my unconscious and grim expectations my co-workers at
my company treat me as a qualified peer.  They ask for my input and
thoughts on important decisions. They pause and &lt;em&gt;listen&lt;/em&gt; when I speak,
considering what I say with as much weight as they would anyone else
on the team. They don't laugh when I ask a question or shame me for
not knowing a fact, instead pointing out that it's &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; that I'm
asking questions and should continue to do so if I don't know
something.  They explain things with patience and clarity and not an
ounce of condescension, and have taken entire man-days to help get me
up to speed on specific projects and technologies.  Working for
my company, and specifically with this team, has given me a greater
understanding of how to be respectful as well as be respected.  I
realized all of the little things that my peers at university said and
did -- that &lt;em&gt;I also&lt;/em&gt; said and did -- that indicated a lack of respect
and awareness, and am slowly learning to not do those things. It's
entirely a work in progress, and I still say or do things that I'm not
proud of.  But I'm much more aware of when I slip up, why, and am able
to apologize and move on more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's most amazing is that all of this is done without any fanfare.
It was taken for granted that I was an intelligent, worthy team member
who has as much to contribute as anyone else on the team. My ideas
were always measured equally, and without the obvious effort or
uneasiness of those learning to respect women. My company has created a
place where I feel welcome, comfortable, and safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why am I telling you this?  Because 6 months ago I thought I would
always have to live with an undercurrent of misogyny.  I thought I
would always be shamed for not knowing some fact, or not getting the
video game reference. And I want you to know that &lt;em&gt;you can expect
more&lt;/em&gt;. I read so many heartbreaking articles and stories about what
women go through at work, and know first hand how &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; it is to be a
minority in the tech industry. And I want to emphasize that my
experience does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; diminish or invalidate the experiences of
others. The way women are treated in my industry is not OK. But I want
you to know that &lt;em&gt;it isn't always like that&lt;/em&gt;, that it &lt;em&gt;doesn't have to
be that way&lt;/em&gt;. My company isn't perfect.  Heck, of our 130 engineers
only ~10% identify as female.  &lt;strong&gt;10%&lt;/strong&gt;.  They just increased maternity
leave from &lt;strong&gt;two weeks&lt;/strong&gt; to six weeks.  But I am valued and
appreciated, implicitly and explicitly. And for that, I am incredibly
privileged and thankful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you for reading!  If you are interested in learning more about
being an ally to minorities, I highly recommend the article&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://codeascraft.com/2016/10/19/being-an-effective-ally-to-women-and-non-binary-people/"&gt;Being an
Effective Ally&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;em&gt;It has been a guiding light to me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] Being aware of that bias has helped me stop doing those things,
but it takes time and concious effort to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

was a surprising delight to read. Like most books I checked it out
only knowing that Powell's had it on their 'New + Recommended' list,
and was pleased when I found myself in the middle of a psychological
thriller, begging the protagonist not to go into the basement. The
novel starts out innocuously, and it wasn't until maybe 2/3 of the way
through that I realized it wasn't going the direction I expected &lt;em&gt;at
all&lt;/em&gt;.  I don't want to give too much away, but this a quick and
satisfying read if you're up for a little horror and a little thrill.
The ending is entirely unexpected, and raises a lot of interesting
points about our identity, perceptions, reality, and the pliability of
the human mind.  I would highly highly recommend it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's my directory structure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;

                        └── testsql.rb
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the output of running &lt;code&gt;puppet app show -e tmpenv&lt;/code&gt; is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
App_one[Health Check Test]
    App_one::Db_component[Health Check Test] =&amp;gt; y21898u9zb3yin5.delivery.puppetlabs.net
        + produces Testsql[Health Check Test]
    App_one::Web_component[Health Check Test] =&amp;gt; hzmjunpoua0mxeo.delivery.puppetlabs.net
        consumes Testsql[Health Check Test]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so, as I see it there are 2 strong candidates for what the
&amp;quot;&amp;lt;APPLICATION&amp;gt;&amp;quot; referred to in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.puppet.com/pe/latest/orchestrator_job_run.html"&gt;puppet orchestrator
documentation&lt;/a&gt; could be: &lt;strong&gt;app_one&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;App_one[Health Check
Test]&lt;/strong&gt;. Here's the output for each of those (using puppet job plan so
that I'm not creating new job id's and logs all over the place):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
[root&amp;#64;hostname environments]# puppet job plan -e tmpenv -a app_one
Failed to submit plan: puppetlabs.orchestrator/unknown-target: The target was not found in environment tmpenv: app_one

terminate called after throwing an instance of 'HorseWhisperer::action_validation_error' what():  Validation Error: You supplied too many arguments to the run command. Only 1 is allowed.
  Aborted
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In desperation, I decide to try a combination of the two &lt;strong&gt;App_one&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
[root&amp;#64;hostname environments]# puppet job plan -e tmpenv -a

Use `puppet job run --application 'App_one' --environment
tmpenv` to create and run a job like this.
Node catalogs may have changed since this plan was
generated.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success!  I later discovered that &lt;code&gt;puppet job plan -e tmpenv -a
&amp;quot;App_one[Health Check Test]&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; also worked.  It's still unclear to me
why the name needs be capitalized, but I trust that there are good and

season, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26893819-the-girls"&gt;The Girls&lt;/a&gt; by Emma Cline.  I was very intrigued by this book
since it had been hyped so much, and after reading it am somewhat
mystified by the noise around it.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't a
&lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; book.  But if I had the ear of millions of people, it's
definitely not the first one I would recommend either. I'll start with
what I liked, compliment sandwich style.  Emma Cline's use of language
is incredible, and her ability to set a scene and make you &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt;
every detail of that scene is unparalleled.  Those tiny things you
notice but would never think to write down, or describe in the way she
does, and then the way she builds entire characters and events out of
those details is amazing. You can feel sticky heat, the stings of
shame, the meaning imbued in a moment's hesitation or a sideways
glance.  All of those microscopic tinges are blown up to full size,
and make the book &lt;em&gt;rich&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so, I loved Cline's writing, why was the book just meh? The
content was really the downfall of this book.  I didn't find any of
the characters compelling, and found it &lt;em&gt;painfully&lt;/em&gt; slow at many
points. There's a murder set up in the opening paragraphs which
becomes the climax of the story, but the journey to that climax takes
&lt;em&gt;so long&lt;/em&gt; and involves little to no detail about the murder.  Someone
dies, and we don't even know or care about that person. The murder is
supposed to be the climax, but at the end falls utterly flat.  I will
give Cline credit for her time-jumping between modern day and memory.
She used it well to develop the main character and made it obvious which
era you were currently reading, both of which are hard to do well and
hard to do well at the same time. But in the end that definitely
couldn't save a half-hearted story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're thinking about picking it up, and leave it at the bottom of
your to-read list. It's definitely worth giving a try, but I wouldn't
hurry to read it.&lt;/p&gt;

read &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.garthstein.com/works/the-art-of-racing-in-the-rain/"&gt;The Art of Racing in the Rain&lt;/a&gt; by Garth Stein. As a dog owner
and lover I was simultaneously excited and wary of another book about
a dog where the dog inevitably the dog dies at the end. But I set
aside my trepidation and dove in, and was rewarded tremendously for
doing so! The book is narrated by a dog, Enzo, as he chronicles the
life of his beloved owner Denny. But it is about &lt;em&gt;so much more&lt;/em&gt; than
the relationship between a man and his dog.  It's about the pain of
cancer and death, the different ways we grieve, and ultimately focuses
on how bad things happen to good people. It's about making the hardest
right decisions, about being the bigger person, all told through the
lens of racing (yes, car racing) by the canine narrator.  And it made
me &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; so strongly.  I had such visceral reactions to the events of
the book, and realized that was part of what made it so good.  The
characters were so compelling, the events so relatable, I found my
blood boiling at points, experienced jubilation and depression and
grief right alongside the characters.  So much malice! So much hope!
The role of the dog as narrator doesn't even really stand out in
hindsight, as it's completely eclipsed by the richness of the rest of
the novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if you couldn't tell, I loved the book and would highly
recommend it. I'll admit it starts out a little slow, but try to power
through at least 1/3 of it before giving up entirely (it's a short
read). It made my rainy Sunday fly by, and is appropriately the perfect
rainy-weekend companion :)&lt;/p&gt;

Puppet class, googled this exact title, and came up totally empty
handed. After wading through dozens of StackOverflow posts and puppet
docs, I still wasn't sure what I needed to accomplish this or how it
would fit into our Beaker tests. I admittedly don't have much
experience with Puppet, and ended up spending a few hours with a
coworker learning about the most efficient way to achieve this.  This
is essentially the post I wish I had found a week ago (or will wish
existed 6 months from now when I need to do the same thing and have
forgotten all of this).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING&lt;/strong&gt;: This post is for n00bs, not l33t
puppet haxxors.  You've been warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OTHER WARNING&lt;/strong&gt;: This post assumes that you already have a
remote puppet master, and are most likely using Beaker or some other
testing harness to interact with that master. You'll also need to make
sure $test_harness has root privileges on the master, as you'll be
writing to &lt;code&gt;/etc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-endgame"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Endgame&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, I wanted to ensure that a UTF-8 encoded class (with non
&lt;code&gt;\A[a-z][a-z0-9_]*\Z&lt;/code&gt; characters) would not be displayed in the
Puppet Enterprise GUI (per &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/reference/lang_reserved.html#acceptable-characters-in-names"&gt;Puppet's acceptable character specs&lt;/a&gt;).  I
needed a bare module with a single class that I could programmatically
throw at a master, and then verify had successfully been applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-solution-s"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Solution(s)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it's impossible to verify that the unicode isn't showing up
because it's unicode, and not because I goofed on adding the class
(yeah, yeah, our logging could be improved), I first needed to get
this test working with a kosher name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="files"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Files&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so really the crux of this problems is what files you need, and
where they need to go on your system.  Since this requires just &lt;em&gt;the one
class&lt;/em&gt;, and none of the other infra around puppetized applications,
only a simple &lt;code&gt;init.pp&lt;/code&gt; is necessary.  Mine looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code puppet literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;myclass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'/tmp/make_sure_this_exists'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;ensure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;present&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few important notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No trailing whitespace! Anywhere!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 spaces, not tab characters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single quotes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.puppet.com/guides/style_guide.html"&gt;more official style guideline&lt;/a&gt;, and even a
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://puppet-lint.com/"&gt;puppet-linter&lt;/a&gt; you can use to verify your &lt;code&gt;init.pp&lt;/code&gt; is
correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so we've got this file, where does it go on the master?  As far as
I can tell most Puppet-y things that we humans deal with live in
&lt;code&gt;/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments&lt;/code&gt;, and since we're taking the
easy road here we're going to be working in the &lt;code&gt;production&lt;/code&gt;
environment. Before you do anything that directory should look
something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
.
└── production
    ├── environment.conf
    ├── hieradata
    ├── manifests
    │&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; └── site.pp
    └── modules
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modules&lt;/strong&gt; is going to be the directory we need to work with.  A
puppet module is a self-contained bundle of code you use to tell
puppet some part of how you want your system to look. There are huge,
widely used puppet modules such as &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/apache"&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt;, or there are cute little
5-line modules like ours, and both specify various related aspects of
a system state to achieve a goal.  That's as much as I'll say about
modules, but you can &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/reference/modules_fundamentals.html"&gt;read more here&lt;/a&gt; if interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: In order for agents to be classified by this class, it needs
to go on the master.  This might not be strictly true all of the time,
but it definitely wasn't going to show up in the GUI or get applied to
agents from another agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="doing-the-thing-manually"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Doing the Thing Manually&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make the directory&lt;/strong&gt;. To make our module, we'll need to make the
following directory from the &lt;code&gt;production&lt;/code&gt; directory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
mkdir -p modules/myclass/manifests`
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;myclass&lt;/code&gt; matches the class name you have in your
&lt;code&gt;init.pp&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copy the file&lt;/strong&gt;. Then put the &lt;code&gt;init.pp&lt;/code&gt; in that directory,
and your set!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verify it worked&lt;/strong&gt;. There are a few ways to verify that you were
successful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSH into the master, run &lt;code&gt;puppet agent -t&lt;/code&gt;, then SSH into your
agent and verify that the file &lt;code&gt;/tmp/make_sure_this_exists&lt;/code&gt;
does indeed exist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the GUI, head to Nodes &amp;gt; Classification, create a new group, then
go to $node_group_page &amp;gt; classes tab and verify your class is in the
dropdown for adding a class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="automate-it"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Automate it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now that we know what we're doing, automating it with Beaker is
pretty easy, especially if we're working in the production
environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make the directory&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code ruby literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="vi"&gt;&amp;#64;class_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'classy'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="vi"&gt;&amp;#64;modules_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;&amp;#64;class_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/manifests&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;master&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;mkdir -p &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;&amp;#64;modules_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copy the file&lt;/strong&gt;. Please note, I needed to define my
&lt;code&gt;init.pp&lt;/code&gt; content inside the file for reasons, but you can
also have a local file and use ruby to read from it, which is a
little more best-practice-y. Also note that you'll need to give the
file proper permissions once you've made it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code ruby literal-block"&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;manifest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;lt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;EOS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sh"&gt;class #{&amp;#64;class_name} {
  file { '/tmp/make_sure_this_exists':
    ensure =&amp;gt; present
  }
}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;  EOS
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;create_remote_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;master&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;&amp;#64;modules_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/init.pp&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;manifest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;master&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;chmod 644 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;&amp;#64;modules_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/init.pp&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verify that it worked&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code ruby literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;master&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'puppet agent -t'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;agent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;agents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;find&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;agent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;not_controller&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;agent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;ls_output&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;agent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'ls /tmp/make_sure_this_exists'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;stdout&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;assert_equal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ls_output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'/tmp/make_sure_this_exists'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;error_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of ways to verify that it worked, this runs
&lt;code&gt;puppet agent -t&lt;/code&gt; on the master (which compiles the catalog and
applies it to all the agents), then verifies that the output of 'ls'
on the master includes the file our class put there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this was helpful and what you are looking for! This is
really the &lt;em&gt;bare minimum&lt;/em&gt;, need-to-know-basis level of creating a
custom class, for when you just need to get the thing done and don't
want to learn &lt;strong&gt;All Of Puppet&lt;/strong&gt;.  If you do want to learn all of
puppet though, there are some links below!  Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

relatable collection of short stories about what it means to be a
modern woman.  My favorite story was hands down The Fitter, but each
is a gem unto itself.  Want to know what it's about? You know how to
find out.&lt;/p&gt;

I love me a good memoir, and Carrie's was the perfect scratch
for my itch. Like Amy Schumer's memoir, HMMaMG is raw and
unapologetic, describing some of the hardest parts of her life and
how she came to be the person she is today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25899336-when-breath-becomes-air"&gt;When Breath Becomes Air&lt;/a&gt; by Paul Kalanithi. I didn't know much
about this book going in, but was stunned by the eloquence and voice
of Paul's writing. His story is interesting and deeply sad, and I
found myself crying on the way to class at the end. Definitely a
short but worthwhile read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26067909-the-assistants"&gt;The Assistants&lt;/a&gt; by Camille Perri. Part office gossip, part juicy
crime novel, I couldn't read this book fast enough.  I loved Camille's
characters, the genius (and not contrived) story, the setting and
conflicts and intimacies of people we work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29340182-shrill"&gt;Shrill&lt;/a&gt; by Lindy West. A reminder that we are all human beings, and
that we need to treat each other accordingly. But told really, really
well. Seriously, just read it, and become the better person you know
you can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 I don't have a comments section on my blog because I find they often

had little background on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Valenti"&gt;Jessica Valenti&lt;/a&gt;.  I knew it was branded
as 'Feminist', whatever that means, but didn't know much else going
in.  Unlike many books I finish, my feelings about it are complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is a chronicle of terrible experiences she has had around
gender, from getting cat-called, to being in abusive relationships,
to getting death threats on the internet.  While I identified with a
number of her experiences and appreciated that her book made me
think more about how I'm treated, I finished it feeling sad and very
much tired of talking about gender.  There's no call to action or
even real cause-effect to her stories. It's just the stories as they
happened, told like the script for a movie: all facts, with little
&amp;quot;Here's how this &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have happened&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Here's what you, as a
man, woman, or child, can do&amp;quot; or even &amp;quot;Here's how I wish I had
reacted&amp;quot;.  I find so often that when &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.lucywyman.me/boy.html"&gt;men don't treat me with
respect&lt;/a&gt; I have no idea how to react in the moment, and wish that
she had provided some guidance or thoughts there.  In the end, she
was only telling me things I already knew with no revelatory
thoughts.  Her book didn't change how I see her, how I see the
world, how I react to various situations, or how I understand gender
or being a woman.  Perhaps she was targeting those who don't even
realize what misogyny looks like, or how common aggression is, but
honestly those people are not the same people who are going to be
reading her book. The people who are going to read her book are
people like me, who know and recognize that they are frequently
treated like sex objects.  In the end, I feel sorry for how
extremely unpleasant many of her experiences are, and that there's
little or nothing she and I can do about it, but I didn't need to
read this book to understand that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for other great reads by great women, I'd
recommend picking up Amy Schumer's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29405093-the-girl-with-the-lower-back-tattoo"&gt;The Girl with the Lower Back
Tattoo&lt;/a&gt;, Jenny Lawson's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23848559-furiously-happy"&gt;Furiously Happy&lt;/a&gt;, Mindy Kaling's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10335308-is-everyone-hanging-out-without-me"&gt;Is
Everyone Hanging Out Without Me&lt;/a&gt;, or Lindy West's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29340182-shrill"&gt;Shrill&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit (10/11/2016):&lt;/strong&gt; I've meditated on the purpose of 'Sex Object'
since writing this, and I think there are a few possible and very
worthwhile reasons she wrote it. First and foremost is to process,
understand, and ultimately come to terms with her experiences.  I hope
she found some modicum (however small) of peace or catharsis in
writing the book.  Second, though, I think it is to tell other women
they are not alone. That sexism and degradation are systemic,
pervasive, and that it is not &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;their fault&lt;/em&gt;.  I know for
many women, including my own mother, the issue of blame and cause is
placed on them instead of the actual actors and perpetrators.  I also want to
acknowledge that to some extent my critique is unrealistic: there
&lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; a solution, an action I should have taken or can take in the
future, to make this better.  There is no call to action because the
best any of us can do is exactly what she did: talk about it, openly
and frankly, and about why it's wrong.  In the end, I think the book
left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth, but I don't think that's
Jessica Valenti's fault, or any reason to not read her book. If
anything, it's a reason you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; read her book.&lt;/p&gt;

books.  This is in part because so much of my attention was directed at my
new job, in part because nothing I was really excited to read came in, in
part because I was spending a lot of time with my boyfriend before he went
back to school.  But I was ready to break my reading-lull when Amy Schumer's
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29405093-the-girl-with-the-lower-back-tattoo"&gt;The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo&lt;/a&gt; showed up in my reading queue.  Amy
Schumer's not someone I pin all of my feminist hopes and dreams (and labels)
to, but I do appreciate her work and many of the ideas she promotes. Needless
to say I was very excited to read her book (the latest in a long list of
biographies I have read and loved!), and it did not disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TGwtLBT is just as much about the hard, scary, sad parts of Amy's life as it
is about the funny, awkward, we've-all-had-this-happen experiences she's had.
Ultimately it's about the experiences that shaped the person and celebrity
she is today, told honestly and sprinkled with humor.  What made the book
stand out was that she wasn't &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to be funny. Often comedian's books
become comedy sets, told in book form. This is fine to an extent, but offers
no insight into who that person is, or what unique experiences they've had.
Instead of trying to make you laugh Amy tells her story as it is, throwing in
jokes and levity where appropriate without sacrificing the integrity of the
book.  More than a fun pick-me-up read, Amy's book helped me understand how
to interact with the mentally ill, how to handle sexist comments, how to be a
person in the world just a tiny bit better.  If you haven't got your hands on
a copy yet, I can't recommend it enough!&lt;/p&gt;

problem in STEM. In high school all of my classes were relatively
50-50 in terms of gender, including science and math classes, and I
had never experienced or noticed anyone treating me differently than
my male peers.  My fist computer science class at university was ~5%
female¹, and as I started to consume more tech media (ie. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/"&gt;Hacker
News&lt;/a&gt;) it became clear the Oregon State was not an exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after 3 years of classes like this, I'm really not sure how to
feel about the dearth of diversity in STEM.  But regardless of the
emotions I cycle through or the discussions I have with people, one
question that frequently gets asked is whether people treat me
differently because I'm a woman,or whether I'm discriminated against.
The answer is yes, of course: it's natural that people treat me
differently because I'm a (very feminine) woman, but more than that I
want to address the skeptical tone people take when they ask if I
experience discrimination.  My intention here isn't to shame people
for their skepticism, compare my experiences to those of others, or
have this be a &amp;quot;Woe is me!&amp;quot; post. But I want my peers to be aware that
I do experience discrimination, and have a variety of negative and
uncomfortable experiences that would likely not have happened, or had
the same negative meaning, if I were a boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="etherpad"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Etherpad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://etherpad.osuosl.org"&gt;etherpads&lt;/a&gt; to organize events for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://lug.oregonstate.edu"&gt;Linux Users Group&lt;/a&gt;, and
each new user can identify themselves manually on the etherpad.  However
everyone has access to each name input, so a single user can put whatever
they'd like as each person's name.  Since most new users don't know about
this feature, or don't care to put their name in, often one person will
put their own name in each name input, so it looks like there are 10
'Elis' all talking to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/etherpad-identify.png" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when planning meetings for LUG this term I took the liberty of doing
this, putting my own name in each of the name inputs.  Later that day
I reopened the etherpad to find the following text at the bottom
of the page: &amp;quot;Lucys been a naughty gurl. She gun get fired&amp;quot;.
I'm confident that the note was a very poorly done joke, meant
to be harmless and completely missing the mark. But it was
humiliating nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-bus"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Bus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A male colleague and I were on a bus from Corvallis to Portland, and
happened to be the only people on the bus.  Almost a year earlier we
had lightly flirted in our interactions, but we had never done
anything and since that time I had started seriously (and
monogamously) dating my boyfriend. So, the colleague and I were
sitting together, first chatting then watching a movie.  He would
occassionally make uncomfortable comments like &amp;quot;I wouldn't mind seeing
you naked&amp;quot;, but I would just ignore them and forge ahead in the
conversation, thinking them relatively harmless. Then when the movie
started he picked my hand up and put it on his upper thigh. Despite
being only a 1.5 hour ride, it felt like the longest of my life. In
all fairness I could have dealt with it much better: I was stunned and
had no idea what to do, so ended up using the computer as an excuse to
remove my hand then just tried to keep to myself and keep distracted
for the rest of the ride, never telling him how uncomfortable that had
made me or that it wasn't ok with me.  In retrospect, I should have
said something. Then again, it probably shouldn't have happened in the
first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-maker-fair"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Maker Fair&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was manning a Lego Robotics booth at the Corvallis Maker Fair.
I had a little demo set up, and spiel about what my organization did, and
spent most of the day showing kids how to program the robots and talking
to very kind parents. As a swarm of kids left the table, one of the event
organizers asked if he could get a short clip of me explaining the demo
and then showing how it worked, and I said sure.  I did the thing, he took
the video, then left with his wife to see other exhibits. A nearby
man who had seen the exchange came up, and after I started giving my spiel
he stopped me mid sentence and said &amp;quot;You know he just wanted your picture, right?&amp;quot;.
Lost for words, I think I just gaped, then turned to someone else and started
helping them with something.  His comment made me so uncomfortable, and
marred what had been a great morning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-21st-birthday"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The 21st Birthday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now I had graduated from university, but was visiting Corvallis to
see my boyfriend and celebrate his roommate's 21st birthday.  It was a
Friday night, and as we were touring the bars and restaurants of
Corvallis we met a few people who were friends-of-friends. This
resulted in a group of 8-10 people eating at a pizza joint, only some
of whom I knew personally. After long conversations that I had a hard
time contributing to, I found a tiny foothold for myself: &amp;quot;Oh, yeah, I
used to love that mine game...mine stopper?&amp;quot;.  &amp;quot;Minesweeper&amp;quot; my friend
said. Then, a voice down the table from someone I didn't know said &amp;quot;No
worries, it's got a lot of numbers in it&amp;quot;. I hope that he didn't mean
to imply that a game with lots of numbers in it would be hard for me
to remember, enjoy, or be good at. But in the moment it felt like I
was being pushed even further out of a conversation I was already not
a part of, and like that &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; what he was implying.  I left shortly
after, holding back tears, and was told that I should have just said
&amp;quot;Fuck you&amp;quot; to the guy and carried on.  I shouldn't have let it ruin
the evening, and should have asserted that it wasn't an OK thing to
say.  But why is that burden on me?  Why didn't my friends defend me,
or even notice that I was visibly upset at the comment?  Why didn't
anyone else think it wasn't OK?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I'm working in the real world, I realize what being treated
equally is like. I love my job, and am a respected colleague at my
workplace.  People who have been in the industry since I was born ask
for my opinion, have me review their work, and I never second guess my
standing among them. This makes discrimination that much clearer to
me: each time someone doesn't assume I'm their equal, it stands out.
It stings. In so many ways, I wish I could go back to when I didn't
notice it. When a comment like that could have been totally innocuous.
But it's not, anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-little-things"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Little Things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;09/20/2016&lt;/strong&gt;: I walk to work everyday, going down Belmont and
crossing the Morrison Bridge. I usually leave between 6:30 and 7,
when it's definitely light outside and there are lots of other
people walking, biking, and driving the same direction.  I listen to
a variety of books and podcasts, and am literally wearing
clothes appropriate for a professional work environment (not that it
matters, but I just want to set the scene here and provide context).
About half way through my walk a construction truck was stopped at a
red light, and as I waited at the same red light one of the men in
the truck wolf-whistled (loud enough to hear through my headphones),
then the other yelled &amp;quot;Nice ass, honey!&amp;quot;.  I ignored them,
pretending I hadn't heard, but they're comments got weirdly in my
head. &amp;quot;Were these jeans not appropriate?  I didn't even put makeup
on this morning, why are you yelling at me?  Can I melt into the
ground right now?&amp;quot;  I realized that I was blaming myself for what
they had said, and wondering what I could do to avoid it in the
future.  Wear baggier clothes? Maybe I should take the bus?  I
talked to another female co-worker about it once I got to work, and
she helped me feel better about it. It wasn't my fault, it didn't
reflect on me at all, it was just two guys who decided to be
assholes and make comments about me on my walk into work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;09/29/2016&lt;/strong&gt;: A female friend and I went to see &amp;quot;The Music of
David Bowie: The Oregon Symphony&amp;quot; at the Schnitz. It was a
&lt;em&gt;wonderful&lt;/em&gt; concert, and as we were walking back to my car, we both
had our phones out looking up directions to my friend's apartment. A
man tapped one of us on the shoulder and said &amp;quot;Were you ladies
filming in there? I'm going to have to confiscate your phones.&amp;quot;  We
both looked at each other terrified.  Were you...? No, neither of us
had our phones out at all during the concert. We shook our heads
&amp;quot;No, we didn't do anything&amp;quot;, then he laughed and said &amp;quot;I'm just
kidding, you ladies both look beautiful tonight&amp;quot;.  We speed walked
away, both totally uncomfortable and dreading the long walk to the
car in the dark.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;02/24/2017&lt;/strong&gt;: In a meeting today the QA team was discussing
changes to our interview process. At one point a coworker was
referring to potential candidates and said &amp;quot;The guy won't get XYZ.
He might not think to do ABC.&amp;quot; and went on to continue referring
potential candidates as exclusively male for the rest of the
meeting. It's such a small thing, and I almost brought it up and
pointed it out, but I know he's not doing it intentionally. But it
does make clear that we unconsciously think of engineers as being
male.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;07/02/2017&lt;/strong&gt;: I spent the day with my partner and 2 close friends.
Overall it was a wonderful day, but at one point I ate the last
piece of an avocado despite my partner saying he wanted it. In
fairness, I should not have eaten it. But I made a joke about it
(&amp;quot;Never stand between a girl and her avocado&amp;quot; or something), and one
of our friends said &amp;quot;I've found that taking things for granted
doesn't end well&amp;quot;, and proceeded to compare me to his coworkers who
complain about the free food at their office. Not only was this
belittling and alienating, but blatantly disrespectful. Had the
roles been reversed with my partner or friend eating the last piece
and making a joke, I doubt the friend would have said a word. I
failed to gracefully respond in the moment, and before I knew it we
were back to other things. But it's good to know now that this
person doesn't respect me as a peer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;08/02/2017&lt;/strong&gt;: Yesterday, my male coworker (we'll call him Doe,
that's not his real name) and I gave a presentation together at DevOps Days
PDX. My email was the one we submitted the proposal to, and the next morning
I had not 1 but 2 emails in my inbox that started &amp;quot;Hello Doe,&amp;quot;, and none
which were addressed to me (or even to both of us). Granted, I think this
could have happened in the reverse as well -- had it been Doe's email, he may
have gotten a number of emails addressed to me after the talk. But at the
same time...that didn't happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experiences are my own and don't necessarily reflect or represent those
of all women in STEM fields, but I hope they do humanize the diversity
struggle in those industries and highlight the ways in which sexism is
still happening.  It's not all bad: I have always received equal pay for
equal work to my male peers, am respected within the community, and
have never felt that I was denied an opportunity, promotion, or
position because I am a woman. At the same time none of the above
experiences would have happened if I were a boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;1 This number comes from me very unscientifically counting the number&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;of people in class who appeared to be female and asking the professor
how many students total were in the class.  I understand that appearance
is not an indicator of gender, and there's possibly errors in
mis-identifying individuals, particularly if they're not gender binary.
I apologize for this, but the point remains the same: the class was
&lt;em&gt;dominated&lt;/em&gt; by male humans&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Places&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cutest little asian market in Oregon! If you're looking for rice
cakes filled with red bean paste, shrimp chips, or dried seaweed, Rice
and Spice is your place. It's run by the nicest couple, and is always
a fun Saturday night adventure to get something you've …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;div class="section" id="places"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cutest little asian market in Oregon! If you're looking for rice
cakes filled with red bean paste, shrimp chips, or dried seaweed, Rice
and Spice is your place. It's run by the nicest couple, and is always
a fun Saturday night adventure to get something you've never tried
before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bald-hill"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Bald_Hill_Loop_Hike"&gt;Bald Hill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just west of the OSU campus, Bald Hill was the perfect place to go for
a run, a hike, a picnic, to watch the sunrise, or just generally to
get out of town for a few hours. With a direct path from campus and a
few different easy trails to hike up, nowhere is more convenient for a
quick dose of natural beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="fred-meyer-loft"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fred Meyer Loft&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best kept secret in Corvallis: the Fred Meyer has a second floor.
It's a great place to sit and read, do homework, or best of all:
people watch without ever making awkward eye contact. Fred Meyer even
has free internet! The perfect little oasis away from it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="osu-used"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://surplus.oregonstate.edu/surplus/public-sales/osused-store"&gt;OSU Used&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever wonder where all the old glass beakers, office chairs, and football
uniforms go once they're past their prime? OSU Used! When I lived in Corvallis
they had sales on the first Wednesday of every month, and I definitely found a
few calculators, cute glass jars, and picture frames there. They also have a
&lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of old computer parts, so if you need a monitor, cable of any kind, or
old laptop, this is the place to go. A great bargain rummage if there ever was
one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="food"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="lemongrass"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/lemongrass-noodle-house-corvallis"&gt;Lemongrass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may not be the best thai food you have in your life, but Lemongrass
really grew on me during my time at OSU. The service is friendly and
quick, the location is practically on campus, and it has all the
staples of a classic thai menu. A great place for first dates, as it's
quiet and you know the food will be good even if the date isn't!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="american-dream-pizza"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://adpizza.com/"&gt;American Dream Pizza&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first moved to Corvallis I really didn't like American Dream.
The crust was too chewy, there was too much cheese and not enough
sauce. But over the years, after many quick lunches and
catching-up-with-friends and late-Saturday-night deliveries (they
deliver until midnight!), Dream really grew on me. Maybe it's just the
nostalgia of a classic college pizza place, but once the sales guy
memorized my order (medium Margherita with extra tomatoes delivered to
the 'Hobbit Hole') and knew the sound of my voice, I knew Dream would
always have a special place in my heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="interzone"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/interzone-corvallis"&gt;Interzone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a co-op and a coffee shop had a baby it would be Interzone. With organic
coffee cake made daily, cardamom-honey lattes, and super spotty wifi, Interzone
was definitely my coffee shop of choice in Corvallis. Whether for one of their
killer bagel sandwiches or a pre-study-session jolt, it's the cutest spot to
meet a friend at or work from!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="broken-yolk"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.broken-yolk.com/"&gt;Broken Yolk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Broken Yolk is the classic American diner. You walk in and for all you know
you're in Iowa, or Delaware, or Nevada. They have great food in generous
portions, and classic breakfast and lunch fare. I've loved everything I've ever
eaten there, and highly recommend for parent's weekend or even a mid-week
brunch. Like all breakfast places it gets pretty busy on the weekends, but
don't be intimidated by the line outside! The restaurant is big, and we've
never had to wait more than 30 minutes. With that said, be careful to not
arrive when you're starving ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's it! Which Corvallis holds a lot of memories and nostalgia for me,
it's a great little town if you didn't attend OSU. If you ever get a chance I
highly recommend visiting, especially now that you know all the best spots to
stop at :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Portland. Whether you're local and looking to try something new, or

&lt;div class="section" id="places"&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="powell-s-books"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.powells.com/"&gt;Powell's Books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the digital age, as book stores around the world close their doors,
Powell's remains a thriving hub of literature.  Even if you haven't
picked up a book in years, Powell's will remind you of the power books
have over us, and make you thirsty for knowledge.  You'll be wandering
aimlessly, not sure what there is for you there, then find yourself
thinking 'I bet that vegetarian cookbook would help me cook at home
more instead of getting takeout', or 'Oooo, I haven't read Phillip K.
Dick in years. I used to love his books', and the game is over. The
book worm, occasional beach reader, skeptical technophile,
wonder-filled child, and dormant literature lover will inevitably find
themselves drawn to one of Powell's 1 million books and fall in love
all over again.  Even if you just come for the corgi-socks, it's worth
the visit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="rose-test-garden"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Rose Test Garden&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Rose Test Garden is one of the most traditionally
beautiful places in Portland.  With several football fields of roses
and several hundred million types of roses, it's easy to lose all
sense of time and space amidst the fragrance and brilliance of the
Rose Test Garden. All kidding aside, the RTG is a must during the
summer months when roses are in full bloom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="serra"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://shopserra.com/"&gt;Serra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right, marijuana is legal in Oregon now, which has resulted in
some of the &lt;em&gt;cutest&lt;/em&gt; and friendliest shops popping up around town. I
think there are a few things that make marijuana shops super great:
1. They're combatting some pretty harsh cultural taboos. Pot is still frequently seen as &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; or seedy (see my parents reaction when they read this post), so the best marijuana stores combat that by being very well lit, open spaces that are &lt;em&gt;beautifully&lt;/em&gt; designed. The staff are often very friendly and knowledgeable too, so you don't need to feel uncool for asking a million questions or leave without knowing what you're putting in your body.
2. Everything is local, by necessity. Because marijuana isn't legal in other states it can't cross state lines, even if it's legal in both of those states (ie. Oregon and Washington). This means you're by default supporting amazing local businesses who are often supplying 100% locally made and extremely high quality products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love Serra because it epitomizes both of these qualities. All of
their shops are in gorgeous old buildings, and are staffed with folks
who will stand there for &lt;em&gt;literally hours&lt;/em&gt; answering all your
questions about strains and chemicals and neurology and side effects.
And honestly you guys, I like consuming (not smoking) marijuana &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt;
much more than drinking. Beyond a glass or two of wine alcohol really
doesn't agree with my system, and has ruined a few nights and
mornings. Marijuana doesn't have those terrible physical side
effects, and provides equally enjoyable inebriation in the right
doses. If you're in town and haven't tried it yet, I highly (ha)
recommend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bagdad-theater"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.mcmenamins.com/bagdad-theater-pub"&gt;Bagdad Theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.mcmenamins.com/"&gt;McMenamin's&lt;/a&gt; is more than a brewery, but an eclectic variety of
refurbished vintage buildings providing places for communities to
gather. The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.mcmenamins.com/bagdad-theater-pub"&gt;Bagdad Theater&lt;/a&gt; is one such place. Located at the heart of
Hawthorne, the Bagdad is the perfect &amp;quot;Portland&amp;quot; place for dinner, a
movie, or both! When my SO was living in Portland over the summer we
would go there almost every Saturday, get a large order of tater tots,
and enjoy the movies they screened there. It's a staple of our lives,
and a staple of Portland culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="books-with-pictures"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bookswithpictures.com/"&gt;Books With Pictures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you love comics or not, you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; make a stop at Books With
Pictures. A &amp;quot;comics&amp;quot; store doesn't do it justice, it's more of a
graphic art store focused on diversity, inclusion, and representation.
The staff is super friendly - I visited knowing almost nothing about
comic books, thinking of 'comics' as the likes of 'Get Fuzzy' in the
Sunday papers, and the staff were approachable and recommended some
reading for me. There's no &amp;quot;Oh you haven't read...?&amp;quot; or shame for not
liking Superman. A mainstay in Portland's book-culture if there ever
was one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ground-kontrol"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://groundkontrol.com/"&gt;Ground Kontrol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most big cities have classic arcades, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://groundkontrol.com/"&gt;Ground Kontrol&lt;/a&gt; is ours.
With about a million pinball machines, classics like DDR and
Ms.Pacman, and newer games like Killer Queen, GK has something for
everyone. Bring your quarters and forget your troubles for a few
hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="food"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="los-gorditos"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.losgorditospdx.com/"&gt;Los Gorditos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone ever asks where I want to get lunch or dinner, I always say
Gorditos. Catering to most dietary needs (with extensive vegetarian
and vegan menus), Gorditos has something for everyone and is
consistently incredible. Their food isn't too pretentious or too
greasy, their portions are generous, and I've literally dreamed about
their breakfast tacos. If you only have time to visit one place in
Portland, make it Gorditos!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="e-san-thai"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://esanthai.com/"&gt;E-San Thai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The food may just be OK, but E-San has a special place in my heart.
My co-workers and I often go there for lunch on Fridays, and I have so
many fond memories of us squeezing 10-18 people into their loft,
laughing together and enjoying a meal. I always get the same thing
(Pad See Ew with Carrots) and have never tired of it! It may seem
blase at first, but take your time at E-San. Admire the old wood and
sturdy construction, the elaborate decorations, the scratches in the
tables and floor that let you know this place is &lt;em&gt;lived in&lt;/em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="dc-vegetarian"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dcvegetarian.com/"&gt;DC Vegetarian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portland is also known for it's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.foodcartsportland.com/"&gt;Food Carts&lt;/a&gt;, and while I can't say
I've tried enough to tell you what that best in the city are, I will
tell you that whenever I go to a food cart for lunch it is always to
DC Vegetarian on 3rd and Alder. Their vegetarian and vegan
sandwiches are better than their meaty counterparts, and my
go-to meal is just $5.50, the cheapest lunch you can get downtown at
lunch hour. I highly recommend the vegan BLT, with avocado of course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="blue-star-donuts"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.bluestardonuts.com/"&gt;Blue Star Donuts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's my duty as a native Portlander to tell you that &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.voodoodoughnut.com/"&gt;VooDoo donuts&lt;/a&gt; are
entirely overrated, and that if you really want the Portland Donut
Experience you absolutely must go to Blue Star. With classic and
exotic flavors, Blue Star donuts are fresh and doughy, not too sweet,
and 100% satisfying. My personal favorite is the Blueberry Bourbon
Basil, but you'll just have to try them all to see which is your
favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="cacao"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cacaodrinkchocolate.com/"&gt;Cacao&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drinkable. Chocolate. Need I say more? Cacao is a super fancy
chocolate place, with a few locations throughout Portland. They have
all the high-quality chocolate your heart could desire, fancy people
who use words like &amp;quot;earthy&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;floral&amp;quot; to tell you about it, and did
I mention the drinkable chocolate?  Warning: you will be consistently
disappointed in hot chocolate after going here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

worried.  Don't let the ads fool you though: this was a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; novel.
I laughed. I cried. I finished it in two days.  The book follows
Louisa Clark, a recently unemployed barista who needs a job to help
her family make ends meet. She takes a job as a sort of low-level
care-giver for a quadriplegic man named Will Traynor, and soon finds
out that he plans to carry out assisted suicide in a few months.  She
takes that time to try to convince him that life, even in a wheelchair
with limited mobility, is worth living, a task which ends up taking
the couple on some (mis)adventures.  It's...kind of a love story?
There's definitely romance. But also &lt;em&gt;so much more&lt;/em&gt;.  As an
able-bodied person, we so rarely think about accessibility, and
increasing the comfort and quality of life for those with
disabilities.  I had never thought about how hard navigating the mall
would be in a wheel chair, how it would feel to not be able to
exercise, and how out of control every aspect of life would be. This
read definitely changed my view of disability, and gave me a lot of
appreciation and gratitude for my body.  It sounds heavy now, but this
book is &lt;em&gt;juicy&lt;/em&gt; as well. 100% page turner.  Definitely worth putting
on your summer list!&lt;/p&gt;

documentation as I should, writing is such a key part of day-to-day human
interaction, and WTD is always a good reminder of basic principles and
encouragement to write more (docs).  It's also an incredibly well run
conference, done through trial and error. Every year they try new things, and
keep the things that work.  It's also one-track, which has pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt;:
* Everyone has the same experience, and it's easy to discuss
* You don't need to make any decisions or miss great talks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;:
* You have to sit through some sub-optimal talks
* Less walking and time between sessions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTD is also held at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mcmenamins.com/CrystalBallroom"&gt;Crystal Ballroom&lt;/a&gt; in Portland, which is a great
venue.  It's friendly. It's not corporate-y. Good vibes all around. There were
also talks. I wrote about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Side Note:&lt;/strong&gt; There were many well-dressed humans, who had very well designed
[clothes | bags | accessories]. It was wonderful to get out of the university
fashion bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="day-1"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="open-source-docs-in-federal-gov-t"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Open Source Docs in Federal Gov't&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Britta Gustafson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contributing to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/whitehouse"&gt;government software&lt;/a&gt; was a thought that had never crossed my
mind, and it turns out that not &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the governments software is horrible and
outdated.  In fact, they have a lot of really cool and interesting APIs, and
are incredibly immersed in Open Source.  Britta recently became a federal
employee, working for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/GSA"&gt;General Services Agency (GSA)&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/18F"&gt;18F&lt;/a&gt;, and
she gave a compelling talk on why contributing to the government helps you help
others.  We often think of the government as a crufty old gross thing that
takes our money and makes bad decisions. But if we want that to change, we
&lt;em&gt;have the power&lt;/em&gt;, especially as software developers. Being part of that
ecosystem can help strengthen a weak and imperfect system, and do good for a
lot of people. All good things to think about, and really a core part of open
source. Great talk, great speaker, great topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="customer-support-docs"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Customer Support + Docs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neal Kaplan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a rough talk. It can really be summed up in one sentence: If you write
docs, you should talk to your customers and customer support team more to get a
feel for what customers need and what your docs are missing.  A good point, but
not a half-hour long point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="documenting-apis"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Documenting APIs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allison Reinheimer Moore&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allison's talk was well put together and well-rehearsed, but without many
memorable takeaways. APIs are so diverse that this is an understandably
difficult talk to execute, and I recall it being unfortunately general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="collaboration-between-open-source-corporate-software"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Collaboration Between Open Source + Corporate Software&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shaun McCance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaun's talk was primarily a call to action for professional technical writers
to help the open source projects they use write good documentation. Often
community members are working on open source projects just for fun, and most
developers don't find writing docs very fun. Understandably. So, as paid people
who use words, if you're already writing docs for something, why not contribute
that to open source?  It strengthens both products, makes the world better,
unicorns poop rainbows, yay.  This was another talk that could really have been
5 minutes of &amp;quot;Hey, here's a thought you might not have had, do the things!&amp;quot;,
but it's a thesis I totally agree with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="lunch"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lunch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually lunch doesn't get it's own section, but lunch at WTD was &lt;em&gt;bomb&lt;/em&gt;. There
was Caesar salad. Fresh veggies + fruit. And pasta with tomatoes, spinach, and
hazelnuts. &lt;strong&gt;So good&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="lightning-talks"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lightning Talks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="dialog-trees"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Dialog Trees&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A talk on tool for making effective dialog trees for video games, specifically
Yarn.  Something I know nothing about, and very well done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="lektor"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Lektor&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Static-site CMS? It's a thing. SSG with dynamic admin site. It seems pretty
cool. Possible fodder for travel blog.  Maybe best talk of the day in terms of
content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="cats-the-perfect-pets"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Cats: The perfect pets&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pantheon"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Pantheon&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not even sure what this talk was about.  It happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="copy-that-helping-users-succeed-with-copy"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Copy That: Helping Users Succeed with Copy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation for people who don't read documentation!  Product copy is the
words you use in the product to guide users, like the label on a button, the
title of a page, etc.  It's definitely one of those things that I don't think
about as often as I should, and was wonderfully specific and detailed.  Sarah
pulled up a page from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://goodreads.com"&gt;GoodReads&lt;/a&gt; and talked about the use and misuse of copy
on that page. There were diagrams, circles, and it was a very well-practiced
and tight talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="readable-readme"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Readable README&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel Beck&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="more-zen"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More Zen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tana Franko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gentle reminder of a few often-heard principles that are easy to forget.
Reframe how you think of problems. Simplify your work. Don't forget to have
hobbies.  This was a very successful and loosey-goosey 15 minute talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="embed-the-docs"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Embed the Docs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kristof Von Tomme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another 15 minute &amp;quot;Thunderstorm&amp;quot;, this time on how important copy is.  Less
well done than the previous copy talk, but no less important a message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="writing-so-your-words-are-read"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Writing So Your Words Are Read&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracy Osborn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long and kind of interesting story?  Not to disrespect Tracy, but stripping out
the self-congratulation at the beginning and giving context in a slide or two
would be much better. Her point of &amp;quot;Know your audience, they aren't necessarily
&lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; is a good one, but again not worthy of a full half hour.  She also makes
a lot of assumptions about how technical people write, which are completely
false in my experience.  I'm definitely not the right audience for this talk,
and as such didn't get much out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="panel-transforming-your-doc-process"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Panel: Transforming Your Doc Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel was probably fine? I don't know, I was really tired + over caffeinated
and in desperate need of food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="day-2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-writing-fiction-teaches-you-about-writing-documentation"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Writing Fiction Teaches You About Writing Documentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday Bram&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday takes principles that everyone (even me -- really, &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;) has
heard when writing fiction and talks about how you can apply it to writing
documentation. It was more effective (for me personally) as a review of writing
principles, but was a very entertaining and example-filled presentation none
the less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="values-of-effective-tech-writing-teams"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7 Values of Effective Tech Writing Teams&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joao Fernandes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thesis: Help build products that need no documentation. In-app help, buttons |
labels | tooltips, clear copy, etc. A few of the same ideas  we've heard
repeated at the conference: be brief, be concise, work with your team, know
your audience &amp;amp; product &amp;amp; market, etc. But, if I had to choose &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of the
talks that covered these topics, it would be this one. The slides were
&lt;em&gt;gorgeous&lt;/em&gt;, and the speaker was relatively charismatic if a bit monotone.  He
also did an interesting thing where he would introduce an practice, then
explain what would happen if you didn't adopt that practice, which seemed more
effective &amp;amp; interesting than just saying to do the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="building-documentation-culture-in-startups"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Building Documentation Culture in Startups&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruthie BenDor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk of the day!  Ruthie is an engineer with a range of experiences, and this
was basically story time of good and bad experiences with docs.  She's a great
storyteller, really interesting tales with good morals &amp;amp; takeaways, and very
funny.  She also covered a 4-step guide to creating great internal docs that's
general and applicable to any org. Super talk!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="following-the-technical-doc-road"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Following the Technical Doc Road&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christy Lutz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very cute Wizard of Oz themed inspiration speech. Believe in yourself, work
with your team, etc. Funny + well-executed + entertaining + ideal for 15 minute
talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="using-csat-data"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Using CSAT Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Betsy Roseberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSAT == Customer Satisfaction.  This was mostly about the value of having
on-page user feedback + comment forms in your docs, and how to use that
feedback productively. Excellent 15 minute talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="just-in-time-documentation"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Just-In-Time Documentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brianne Hillmer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thesis: write your documentation when you know what problems your customers
are having, don't try to guess what problems they will have in the future.
This ends up being lots of short articles like &amp;quot;There's a gear button in the
top left that looks little but actually takes you to what you want&amp;quot; that are
only 2-3 paragraphs, but are exactly what people need. Overall very well
executed, and especially able to keep the audience focused while smelling
Burrito lunch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="id1"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lightning Talks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="organizing-meetups"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Organizing Meetups&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely valuable if you're looking to start a meet-up, and the speaker seems
like a very sweet if not well-spoken man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="documentation-in-academia"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Documentation in Academia&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given by my hilarious co-worker Jack, I'm 100% biased here. But like everything
Jack does I thought it was clever, funny, and educational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="earning-user-trust"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Earning User Trust&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="interactive-document-environments"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Interactive Document Environments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim Nugent &amp;amp; Paris Buttfield-Addison&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also a great talk! Interactive Documentation Environments are Code + Notes +
Docs, and are a very pretty way of rendering and compiling together those
three things into kind of actual docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="accessible-math-on-the-web"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Accessible Math on the Web&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim Arnold&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MathJax + MathML. If you haven't looked into them, you should!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="oops-i-became-an-engineer"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Oops, I Became an Engineer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tara Scherner de la Fuente&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#64;goatuserstories is a funny twitter. Follow your dreams! Consider community
college! Win + profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="main-takeaways"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Main Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider working for the government. It won't get better by you being angry
at it, and they actually do some very cool things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What's the current state of your internal docs? It's so easy to focus on external
docs, but your employees need docs too! A good litmus test is how long it takes
a new hire to get their first PR up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look out for Lektor and Interactive Documentation Environments. The future
is bright and beautiful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember your basic writing and humaning principles: know your audience;
be brief; ask questions; have respect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

in his last year of life, the book is about coming to terms with
death and living a meaningful life, through the eyes of both a

Paul's voice and writing are absolutely stunning. The content
as well as delivery are beautiful, and I found myself crying
on the way to class listening to the very end. A short and
worthwhile read for any audience.&lt;/p&gt;

you know you'll be tripping to Powell's to pick up some summer reads.
I wanted to make this a regular reading list with a variety of ficiton
and nonfiction books, and I realized that 90% of my choices were
biographies or memoirs.  If you're not into them, don't despair! There are
a few juicy fictional reads at the top of the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_potter_series"&gt;The Harry Potter Series&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on your appetite this series
can take a while, but I recently re-read the whole series and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/harry-potter-series.html"&gt;loved it&lt;/a&gt;.  Definitely worth revisiting if you haven't in a
while, or if you've never read them to begin with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Help"&gt;The Help&lt;/a&gt;. If you haven't already, you should.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/me-before-you"&gt;Me Before You&lt;/a&gt;. I know, I know, it's on every list. I was
skeptical too. But trust me, this book is &lt;em&gt;candy&lt;/em&gt;. Excellent for
any reader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_Weapons"&gt;Use of Weapons&lt;/a&gt;. Even if you aren't familiar with the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_series"&gt;Culture series&lt;/a&gt;,
and don't want to read all 9 books, Use of Weapons is a fantastic stand alone
novel.  The chapters alternate between going forwards in time and backwards,
the characters are impossibly rich and well written, and the twist at the
end will leave you speechless and teary-eyed. Even if you're not a sci-fi
buff, definitely worth reading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/books/committed-a-love-story/"&gt;Committed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/"&gt;Big Magic&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/books/eat-pray-love/"&gt;Eat, Pray, Love&lt;/a&gt;.
You've definitely heard of the last one, but
the first is &lt;em&gt;so much better&lt;/em&gt;. Elizabeth Gilbert is 100% my favorite author,
my guilty pleasure, my comfort food, and her voice is miraculous. I like her
non-fiction better than her fiction (just personally, no literary criticism
here), but anything she writes will definitely lift your day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://thebloggess.com/furiously-happy/"&gt;Furiously Happy&lt;/a&gt;. I'm not sure if this qualifies as a biography, but it
seems close enough. I've read &lt;em&gt;several&lt;/em&gt; comedic ladies biographies (
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/books/bossypants-by-tina-fey-review.html"&gt;Bossypants&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://amysaysyesplease.com/"&gt;Yes Please&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11230081-seriously-i-m-kidding"&gt;Seriously, I'm Kidding&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.avclub.com/review/mindy-kalingem-is-everyone-hanging-out-without-me--64875"&gt;Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) and though hilarious and
inspiring I find the story often gets lost in the authors trying to be
funny. Granted being funny in writing (even in an audiobook) is like marathon
level hard. But &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://thebloggess.com/"&gt;Jenny Lawson&lt;/a&gt; definitely pulls it off in her reading of
her second book &amp;quot;Furiously Happy&amp;quot;, and includes a lot of personal moments
that help plebs like me understand mental illness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://piperkerman.com/orange/about-the-book/"&gt;Orange is the New Black&lt;/a&gt;. I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; the show, but it definitely takes
a lot of artistic license. Piper's actual experience, though less exciting,
is fascinating and well-told.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anything by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sedaris#Bibliography"&gt;David Sedaris&lt;/a&gt;. I especially love &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holidays_on_Ice"&gt;Holidays on Ice&lt;/a&gt;, if you're
a Sedaris newbie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Audacity_of_Hope"&gt;The Audacity of Hope&lt;/a&gt;. Perfect for a quick weekend read, Obama's cool
personal story and charismatic voice make this feel good, palate-cleanser

and men's version (ie. deodorant, socks, haircuts, etc.). IMHO this
isn't sexist so much as acknowledgment that men and women are
physically different creatures, BUT, sometimes the men-version of a
thing is much better (for one reason or another) than the
lady-version, even if you identify as a lady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few things I like to buy the non-lady versions of, and
why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flannels&lt;/strong&gt;. They're often cheaper and always thicker, and while
the cut is slightly less flattering the men's cut definitely looks
great &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; will actually keep you warm. Mine are from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.jcpenney.com/g/st-johns-bay-men/N-bwo3yZ7h"&gt;St. John's
Bay&lt;/a&gt; (I promise they came in cuter colors when I bought them!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Underwear&lt;/strong&gt;. I have a medium-to-large sized + very round butt,
and underwear &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; rides up and I have to fidget and pull it
down all day long. Even ladies boyshorts do this, since they
still barely cover my actual butt.  Instead, I've been wearing
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.meundies.com/products/trunk"&gt;MeUndies Men's trunks&lt;/a&gt; for about a year now, and am never
looking back.  They last longer, don't squeeze my hips, provide
full coverage, and look really cute + sexy!  Well worth the
investment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hair Cuts&lt;/strong&gt;.  Considering the head of hair I have, I definitely
need to ask a barber first before having them cut my hair.  Even
certified curly-hair cutters find my hair daunting.  That
said, the best hair cut I ever got was from University Cuts
Barber Shop for ~$15. With curly hair, even fancy salon hair
cuts are very hit-or-miss, and there's nothing worse than
dropping $60 (or more) and having triangle hair.  Even dressers
certified by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.devacurl.com/"&gt;Deva Curl&lt;/a&gt; have not been up to the task!  Whether
due to bravery, styling skills, or sheer luck, I've had better
luck at barber shops.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sweat pants&lt;/strong&gt;. Though I enjoy the shape and fit and lady-cut
jeans, I want my sweat pants to baggy, comfy, soft, and roomy. I'm
not trying to impress anyone here, I just need my body covered and
warm. I ordered a pair of lady sweats in a large from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.american-giant.com/"&gt;American
Giant&lt;/a&gt;, and though stretchy they were fitted! From booty to
mid-shin, the sweats were right up against my skin, with none of
the desired baggy roomy comfiness. I don't need to be feeling a hug
around my upper thighs all day. Conversely, my boyfriend's size
medium sweats fit me perfectly -- they give me plenty of room to
move in, are thicker, and don't show whether I'm wearing underwear
or not. And I can say I'm a medium :D . So we traded sweats (since
the larges were baggy on him), and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

though unlike &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/brooklyn.html"&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt; I was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't inspiring or
great or anything, nor does it claim to be. It's a very real portrait of
high school, and of someone you know of (but don't really &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt;) dying.
As with any media set in high school your mileage may vary -- no one
has the same experience, and there were definitely a lot of inconsistencies
with my experience of high school. But no matter what your experience was,
it takes you back to the time before adulthood, and the first time you
experienced that confusion and sadness of loss. The main character, Greg,
is a self-depricating, uninspired human in the thick of the teenage years.
He's incredibly well-written, and allows you to forget that he's totally
fiction. It was a great break from
a few more heady books I'm in the middle of, and is a great weekend read
if you're looking for something more seroius than a romance novel but less
serious than LOTR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.werteric.com/"&gt;Eric&lt;/a&gt;, Eli's stepdad drove us from Corvallis to Portland Friday afternoon at

&lt;h2&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.werteric.com/"&gt;Eric&lt;/a&gt;, Eli's stepdad drove us from Corvallis to Portland Friday afternoon at
great expense of his time. After ~3 hours in the car we went straight to the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mcmenamins.com/219-bagdad-theater-pub-home"&gt;Baghdad Theater&lt;/a&gt; on Hawthorne to grab dinner and see the new &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3040964/"&gt;Jungle Book&lt;/a&gt;.
It was a solidly C+ movie: visually beautiful, conceptually just like the
original, as an adult not especially satisfying.  But also a good time with
good people, and excellent food (hunger is the best sauce).  After that we went
back to the house to have cake + presents, and DRINK BEER (like one beer each).
Because Eli and I are actually 80 year olds we went to our fancy-schmancy HOTEL
at ~10 and immediately fell asleep.  Typical friday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="saturday"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Saturday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday we woke up late, found breakfast at a non-descript chain (don't judge
us, food in Portland is mad expensive), then wandered over to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.powells.com/"&gt;Powell's&lt;/a&gt;. I
bought a huge bag of cashews and two donuts at Whole Foods which was hands-down
the best purchase I made in all of April, Eli tooled around the book store and
bought a book of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dilbert.com/"&gt;Dilbert&lt;/a&gt; comics, then we decided to go to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://groundkontrol.com/"&gt;Ground Kontrol&lt;/a&gt;.
After $10 of pinball and one totally bullshit round of Tetris, we ran out of
cash money so headed out. With nothing else to do, we decided to take an urban
hike to Eli's parents house, hoping we would arrive around 5pm when we had
agreed to meet them.  This ended up being about 8 miles, which sounds like a
lot but really wasn't that bad. It was also a &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt; day, and we got to
see some cool parts of Portland we don't typically frequent such as the
Tillikum pedestrian bridge and Waterfront.  It also timed out well, as we got
to the house around 16:30 and got to eat + hang out for a bit before heading
out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eli's mom and stepdad are both artists who work from home, and as such are
&lt;em&gt;really cool&lt;/em&gt; and get to rub elbows with a lot of &lt;em&gt;really cool&lt;/em&gt; people.  Like,
it's actually a little intimidatingly cool.  They have a friend who recently
travelled to Paris + Tokyo and spent a few months meeting little-known artists
in those areas through word-of-mouth.  He then compiled his experiences and
interviews with these artists into &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://overcupbooks.com/products/the-tall-trees-of-paris"&gt;a series&lt;/a&gt; and sold it. For money. &lt;em&gt;That's
how cool these people are&lt;/em&gt;.  We talked to him about places we should visit
while in Paris this summer, then got a back-stage tour of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://giganticbrewing.com/"&gt;Gigantic brewery&lt;/a&gt;.
It was very exciting. They print unique art from local artists on each beer
they brew, and we got to see the wall of labels, hear about how they choose the
artist, learn a little about how the brewery started, and see their super
high-tech bottling process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After grabing some brews and buying some souvenirs (a copy of the book and a v
cute hoodie), we headed up to Mississippi st. to have dinner and go to the
concert. Most of the super cute shops Mississippi is know for had closed for
the night by the time we got there, but we were able to dart into a few just
before 7, then found a thai place accross the street from the venue.
Unfortunately the food there was &lt;em&gt;super spicy&lt;/em&gt; and ended up making everyone but
me either cry, or get a little sick.  Keep in mind this is not because I am
impervious to spiciness but because I know I'm weak and ordered the &lt;em&gt;most mild&lt;/em&gt;
dish.  After dinner we went to the venue, got our tickets, and played &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.headsup&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Heads
up&lt;/a&gt; for half an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-show"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Show&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show was excellent! Mississippi is a super cute, cozy, and friendly venue,
and we got a little booze before the show started.  The opener, Riot Lion
Something was surprisingly good -- not only was their music great, but her
voice is &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; live, and they were great performers. It was a totally
unexpected and awesome way to start the evening. Then Hippocampus came on
around 10, and having already done a show earlier that day (like, 3 hours
earlier) they were understandably a little tired.  The band itself is composed
of 4 &lt;em&gt;very attractive&lt;/em&gt; young men, who despite being under 21 had poise, style,
and great stage presence.  Call me biased or shallow, but they were super fun
to watch.  They also interacted with the crowd quite a bit, which I think adds
a lot to a good show, and they played some of their newer stuff as well.  The
show was super short (they only have 2 EPs out, and honestly played everything
I knew of theirs as well as a few new songs, so this wasn't unexpected), and we
caught an 11 pm bus back to downtown Portland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eli was pretty beat by this point, but I was craving something chocolatey so we
decided to hit &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://departureportland.com/"&gt;Departure&lt;/a&gt; before going to bed.  Departures is a fancy
restaurant on the top floor of the Nines hotel, and in the elevator we noticed
a couple that had on shirts that were just Bob Saget's face. Like, not just a
square of his face, like the whole shirt was Bob Saget's face. It was a little
unsettling.  Apparently he had been performing downtown earlier that evening,
and there were just &lt;em&gt;tons&lt;/em&gt; of people from the show going to Departures
afterwards. &amp;quot;So &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is what people do after 10pm&amp;quot; we thought simultaneously.
It's also worth mentioning here that I had never seen Full House and didn't
know who Bob Saget was, let alone recognize him.  We got to our table in the
restaurant, and after ordering Eli told me to look behind me. I did and was
like &amp;quot;Wow, yeah, that is a lot of cleavage&amp;quot; and Eli was like &amp;quot;What? No, Bob
Saget is behind you&amp;quot;. He took a fuzzy, Sasquatch-esque picture, we ate our
brownie + ice cream (the bomb dot com), and headed home to pass out around 1
am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="sunday"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sunday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday morning we woke up late (like, 9am. #students), and went to Fancy Brunch
at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://originaldinerant.com/"&gt;The Original&lt;/a&gt;.  Then we wandered down the waterfront, listened to a few
episodes of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.mythpodcast.com/"&gt;The Myths and Legends Podcast&lt;/a&gt;, then headed to the bus stop. It
was one of those beautiful days where you just do nothing, enjoy the sunshine
and the passers by and good company, the kind of day Sundays are perfect for.
And then, all too soon we were home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall it was a very fun and relaxing trip. It's always nice to get outside
The Cultural Bubble that is University, remember that life isn't all deadlines
and exams, and experience a little art and outdoors.  10/10 would recommend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ohnopodcast.com/"&gt;Oh No Ross and Carrie&lt;/a&gt; -- the show where they don't just report on
fringe science, spirituality, and claims of the paranormal, but take
part themselves! Honestly, whether you enjoy hearing about UFO
conferences and acupuncture or not, Ross and Carrie are 2 of the
loveliest people you'll listen to. They're who I listen to when I've
had a particularly stressful day, and need a few deep breaths of
fresh air.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolabmoreperfect/"&gt;More Perfect&lt;/a&gt;, the podcast about the Supreme Court, by Radio Lab.
Though often a bit depressing (aren't stories about people with
power always depressing?), More Perfect is very well researched,
high quality, and relevant pod.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.younghouselove.com/category/podcast/"&gt;Young House Love Has A Podcast&lt;/a&gt;. I'm honestly not very 'into' interior
design or home stuff, but I love this couples' banter and their
relationship. In it for the laughs, with some tips about lighting on
the side :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gimletmedia.com/show/mystery-show/"&gt;The Mystery Show&lt;/a&gt;. Starlee Kine, who you've definitely
heard on This American Life, solves mysteries that can't be
solved online. These aren't the &amp;quot;Who was that guy in that movie?&amp;quot;
questions, but questions like &amp;quot;There's one photo of Britney Spears
holding a book that only sold 100 copies. How did she get a hold of
it?&amp;quot; kind of questions. It may sound like a strange and unlikely
premise, but Starlee executes it &lt;em&gt;perfectly&lt;/em&gt;, and has definitely
mastered storytelling.  She's also a delightful narrator, and her
conversations with people are among the most interesting parts of
the show. She's so interested in the lives of the people she talks
to, and even without the mystery part just listening to her interact
with other humans is inspiring.  All in all, one of the best podcast
finds of the last year.  There are only 6 episodes, and it seems to
have gone offline, but never lose hope!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gimletmedia.com/show/reply-all"&gt;Reply All&lt;/a&gt;. Hosted by PJ Vogt (pronounced &amp;quot;vote&amp;quot;) and
Alex Goldman, Reply All is a show about the internet.  With
top-notch banter and interesting topics, I've learned a lot from
Reply All (mostly about twitter, but also about who invented email
and how terrorists communicate) and laughed out loud in very public
places.  Even if you're not a &amp;quot;techie&amp;quot; Reply All will probably float
your boat.  Try a few episodes, then write me a thank you note.
You're welcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/dopequeens/"&gt;2 Dope Queens&lt;/a&gt;. A new comedy podcast, 2 Dope Queens
is live comedy hosted by Phoebe Robinson and Jessica Williams. It's
a nice break from the more serious podcasts, and as a comedy-world
newbie I find myself laughing out loud multiple times during each
episode.  Whether you already have a favorite comedy podcast or not,
I would highly recommend giving 2DQ a try (obviously, it's on this
list).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.wbur.org/series/dear-sugar"&gt;Dear Sugar Radio&lt;/a&gt;. DSR is one of my newer finds, and I've fallen
in love.  Hosted by Cheryl Strayed and Steve Almond, DSR cover
universal topics like infidelity, lying, and other struggles we all
experience by reading and answering letters from listeners. I grew
up listening to Dr. Laura with my mom, and have seen the light!
There is a better way! And this podcast is it. Like, imagine Dr.
Laura hosted by nice and reasonable people instead of mean | crazy |
racist people.  It's honey in my life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://howtodoeverything.org/"&gt;How To Do Everything&lt;/a&gt;. This show is just a way better version of
Stuff You Should Know.  This podcast is the Mecca of banter, the
banter that every duo aspires to, the kind of banter that
&lt;em&gt;inspires&lt;/em&gt;.  They also cover all types of questions, calling experts
to answer questions like whether dolphins sleep, if wasps can
recognize each other, and how to do arm-farts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://getcrookedmedia.com/here-have-a-podcast-78ee56b5a323"&gt;Pod Save America&lt;/a&gt;. Former speech writers for the Obama administration
discuss current political events and interview prominent political
figures. A nice breath of fresh, democratic air during troubling times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://kexp.org/podcasts"&gt;KEXP Music That Matters&lt;/a&gt;. Spotify Discovery Weekly not doing it
for you?  Each week they put out a curated playlist centered on a
theme, and the music ranges from punk to hard rock to folk to pop to
country and beyond.  Some are great, some aren't, but it's worth
wading through the rough stuff to find the gems. They also tend to
focus on artists local to the PNW, which means it's a great way for
me to find shows playing in the area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Podcasts I Listen To That You Probably Do Too:
These are in the order from favorite to least favorite, though if
I didn't like any of them I just wouldn't listen to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.myfavoritemurder.com/"&gt;My Favorite Murder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

yesterday.  This is my third year and final year organizing the unconference,
and all was strangely calm.  I'm not sure what magical forces to attribute this
to, but usually there is a sharp spike in meetings, tasks, and general PANIC on
the media team starting in mid-January leading up to Barcamp.  Perhaps thanks
to our beautiful + talented writer Amanda, perhaps because our workflow was
&amp;quot;What did we do last year? Yeah, do that&amp;quot;, perhaps because we were old-hat now,
everything seemed to go smoothly and be stress-free. 120 attendees, 32 talks,
too many burgers to count, it was a great time. For me Barcamp is a chance to
see a lot of alumni and old friends that I don't get to see very often, so it
was nice to have a solid chunk of time in the morning to say hello to everyone
and get sufficiently caffeinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="lightning-talks"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lightning Talks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first talk I went to was Lightning Talks, which is a grab-bag of topics in
5-minute installments. As expected some talks were great and some were very
meh, but I definitely learned some new and interesting things about unexpected
topics. The best talk was Eli's on Art History (totally not biased), though one
talk on Explaining Myths in the Theater (ie. &amp;quot;Break a leg&amp;quot;) was also very well
done + interesting, as well as one on how to Correctly have a Polictical
Discussion.  Overall it was a good way to start the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="rust-types-traits"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rust Types + Traits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't gotten on the Rust or Go trains yet, and honestly don't plan to in
the near future, but I do try my best to know what's what with the Hip New
Languages. Though not the best speaker, Mythmon is very knowledgable on the
topic not just of Rust but of language design in general, and the content of
his talk was definitely ideal for my background knowledge.  This was the talk
that I got the most out of at Barcamp, and it helped me be more comfortable
participating in discussions of Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-to-watch-professional-starcraft"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Watch Professional Starcraft&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aspiring video gamer, I was pretty stoked about this talk. I laughed, I
embarrassed myself, I learned a lot about Starcraft. This was a good post-lunch
break from thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="zendo"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Zendo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zendo is an &lt;em&gt;addictive&lt;/em&gt; game. The idea is you have several pyramidal structures
like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="static/zendo.png" style="height: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Master thinks of a simple rule for structures that can be built with the
pyramids. For example, some good rules are &amp;quot;A large piece must touch a small
piece&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;There must be at least six pips in the structure&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;There
must be a blue and white piece in the structure&amp;quot;, etc. Then each player&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely the most entertaining of the &amp;quot;talks&amp;quot;, and it was hard to tear myself
away at 10 to 4pm, when my talk was scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bbq"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BBQ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, we hosted a BBQ at Avery Park after the event.  Good food, good
company, great weather, what more can you ask for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was excellent to see some familiar faces again, and have a day off from
thinking about school.  Since I'm writing this last sentence on September
13th, 5 months after barcamp actually finished, I'm just going to leave it
there and publish this now.  Writing a blog is hard guys.&lt;/p&gt;

it was made into a movie, and had something to do with a
young woman, the early 20th century, and probably
Brooklyn, NY.  Honestly, even that was too much:
I spent much of my time reading it trying to figure out
why someone would choose to turn &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; book into a film
and came away disappointed.  It was blasé, and while I
don't want to diminish the experience of immigrants
to NY in the early 1900s there was nothing unique,
clever, eye-opening, or otherwise remarkable about the novel.
I liked the main character well enough, but found that
in the end I didn't care what happened to her or any of
the other characters. The main character Eilis and her
sister Rose feel very much like female characters written by
a man. You can very clearly see the lens through which
he views them, the brush strokes he uses to create them,
and that makes them seem very unreal.  They feel more
like what you would get if you asked your well-meaning
grandfather to describe his first love interest than
real women, and without the connection to the characters
I found myself struggling to hold on to anything in the
novel.  I appreciate that Tóibín wrote a novel that centered
on strong female characters, and that such a novel
could be turned into an award-winning film. But before
we congratulate ourselves on appreciating a novel about
a woman who travels alone to America, goes to college
and works, and chats with her sister and female roommates,
let's consider that Eilis probably experienced a lot of
fear, racism, sexism, uncertainty, and hardship that
is generally glossed over. Overall I was underwhelmed,
and wouldn't recommend it if you've got other books
on your list to read.&lt;/p&gt;

describing how math is used (and misused) in everyday
life. From the lottery, to elections, to predicting
the weather and the existence of God, Ellenburg
explains how to develop a better intuition for all the number
and percentages swirling around the news and media. It
focuses mostly on statistics, but also delves into
geometry + algebra (and their relationship), multi-dimensional
spaces and linear algebra, and number theory. As a
&amp;quot;relatively mathy&amp;quot; person, I definitely felt like I got a
lot out of it,though I'm not entirely sure I would recommend
it to less mathematically-inclined readers. Although I believe
it was intended for that audience, and is definitely an
accessible view into high mathematics, it's also a book
about math. My point being: don't expect to be spoon fed
math and magically become knowledgable. Like with all knowledge,
you've gotta put in a little work. But it's &lt;em&gt;totally worth it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Some favorite quotes:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;And you can't deny that there are aspects of the natural world - I'm
thinking pandas here - that seem more likely to have resulted from grudging
bureaucratic compromise than from the mind of an all knowing deity with
total creative control&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;For those who are willing to adopt a view of probability as degree of belief
Bayes theorem can be seen not as a mere mathematical equation, but as a form
of mathematically flavored advice&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;

including depression and anxiety.  I'm not really sure if it's a
memoir or autobiography or neither, but you can think of it as a
series of blog posts about things that happen in her life, and her
thoughts.  It is &lt;em&gt;hilarious&lt;/em&gt;, and poignant, and helps people who don't
have disorders understand what's it like to have a disorder (I
think....I don't have a disorder, so can't confirm this, but I
definitely &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like I have a better understanding of them now).
She describes what it's like when they get especially bad in very
relatable ways, using experiences that most humans have had, and
without asking for pity.  It's also not just about feels and sad
things -- she narrates her life with silliness and humor, and many of
the experiences themselves are hilarious as well. From waking up to
find her arms are asleep, to having her daughter congratulate her on
making friends, Lawson talks about experiences we've all had without
fear of self-deprecation.  &amp;quot;Furiously Happy&amp;quot; is a fun and
thought-provoking read.  As a side note, I realize this whole post is
very effusive and only has nice things to say about the book. I
honestly have nothing bad to say about it. I expected it to be a quick
and funny read, and got &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more than I bargained for, which is just
about all you can ask of a book. As a sub-side-note, I highly
recommend the audio-book version as well. It's narrated by the author,
has several &amp;quot;extra&amp;quot; little bits in it, and Lawson's narration
definitely adds a lot to the experience of consuming the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-process"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as I recently learned, the interview process for
most tech organizations has three parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="0"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The application. This is like the profile part of
online dating. You submit your resume, the shiniest
version of yourself in the form of paper, but you lie about
knowing Rust instead of liking beer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The HR person. This is usually a 10-15 minute call
with a really nice person
where they ask things like &amp;quot;What are you interested in?&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;When do you graduate?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Are you willing to relocate?&amp;quot;, etc.
They're just trying to ascertain if you're a good fit for the
position you're interviewing for. This is the initial chat
of online dating, but less awkward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The technical interview.  This is 1 or 2 phone calls
with an engineer where they ask you to solve a problem or
two in a shared document. The problems are almost always
related to algorithms, data structures, or networking.
Seriously, know your networks man.  This is the first/second
date stage of the interview, where you try to decide if
this is even someone you want to get involved with and if
there's any possibility for romance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The on site. If your technical interviews go well and
you seem like a good fit, you'll have an on site interview.
This is like 1-2 years of dating in 5 hours.  This is where the company
flies you down to their
location and interviews you for 5-6 hours in 45-60 minute
chunks, usually with 1-2 engineers per interview.  Yes, they
are exhausting, no matter how many times people ask if you
need water or coffee. It also gives you an appreciation for
how arduous transporting humans from point A to point B is.
This is their (and your) last chance to see if you're ready
to commit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the onsite, you're just waiting to hear back. Usually it takes between
a week and a month, but if you haven't heard anything in 1.5 to 2 weeks it's
appropriate to contact the recruiter you've been talking to and ask when
you should expect to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-companies"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Companies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="apple"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Apple&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I interviewed with Apple on a Monday in early January.  You know
those industrial parks you go to when your Comcast shit isn't working,
where they have miles of rectangular concrete buildings where souls go to die?
That's what Apple HQ looks like.  I know, I know, they're building a new
campus that's going to be the bestest tech campus in The World and Mars, but
for now it's pretty subpar.  There's nothing to see or do in Cupertino, so
when I got there an hour early I ended up just going to Safeway and getting
mouth wash.  After checking in and hanging out for a while, the marathon began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up having 6 45-minute interviews with a lunch break after Round 2.
Each interview was with two engineers from the team I was applying to be on,
and overall I thought I showed as well as I could have.  There were some
engineers I instantly clicked with and really liked, and others that were
much less inviting, but on the whole it was as pleasant as 7 hours of
interviewing can be.  More often than not the interviewing wrapped up
early, and in asking their engineers about how they liked Apple it
was clear that every engineer there drank the Apple kool-aid. Maybe this
seems obvious since they work there, but interviewing at Apple made me
realize how important Open Source Software is to me.  I thought it was
something I could take or leave, but sentences like &amp;quot;I enjoy the big
reveals, a lot of times I have no idea what the final product will
look like as we're working on it&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I can't talk to my neighbor
about what I'm doing&amp;quot; gave me literal chills.  It's definitely for
some people, just not me. There were also startingly few women at
Apple, particularly in engineering roles, which was another big red
flag for me.  This isn't to say Apple's a bad place or company, just
that it wasn't the right fit for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="google"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Google&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google (Mountianview) had a &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt; campus. I got there ~2 hours early, and spent the whole
time exploring sites like the Android Garden, little google shops, and generally
wandering around. It's like it's own small, clean city with beautiful landscapes,
an amphitheater, movies, shops, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/android-garden.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I was in the right place, the interviewing
began right away.  As I said, I won't discuss the details of questions asked, but
the google interview questions were very fun to consider, reason about, and optimize.
I found myself thinking about the questions over the next few days and trying to
improve my answers, and at the end of the day found that I was energized rather than
exhausted by the problems put before me.  You can find some &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.impactinterview.com/2009/10/140-google-interview-questions/"&gt;retired google interview
questions&lt;/a&gt; online, but I will say that in my experience they're unlike questions
asked by any other company.  Use for fun or brain work, not general interview practice.
The engineers were all very nice and interesting, and it was clear that each was
passionate about technology and working at Google (of course).  Though this was
exciting as a soon-to-be graduate, it also hinted at how each persons &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt;
was Google, and seemed that culturally it would be very hard to have kids or
real hobbies outside of work.  I know this is something they are working on, and
can't confirm that this is culturally true, it was just the vibe I got during
my very short time there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/expectant-mother.jpg" style="height: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This onsite consisted of 4 hour-long interviews with a lunch break, each
interview being one-on-one, which I found much more manageable than two-on-one.
The interviews were very directed and structured, which I really liked, and left
plenty of time for me to ask questions of my interviewers.  It's also worth
mentioning that my interviewers were diverse in terms of race, gender, and age,
which was refreshing. Once I had finished, I was on my way!  Google has a very
nifty interview process, whereby a committee reviews your interview
based on notes the interviewers take in order to minimize any biases the
interviewers may have. The committee then determines whether to hire you or
not, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; once you're hired they place you in a department or project you're
interested in. So you don't interview for a particular position, and you're
not competing with other brains for the same job: it's just a matter of
whether you're up to snuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I had a really good time interviewing for Google, and despite
not getting the job consider it a great experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="linux-foundation"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Linux Foundation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't get as far into the LF interview process, but want to write
about it because their code challenge &lt;em&gt;consumed&lt;/em&gt; my life for a solid
week. This is mostly my own fault: the challenge was to create a
site using Drupal, which I have ample experience doing, and so
as a challenge I chose to use Drupal 8 instead of 7.  Never. Again.
Drupal 8 has some great and cool features, namely better templating.
But it's not well documented, not widely used, and is &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt;
different from Drupal 7. I was in way over my head, and honestly
spent probably close to 50 hours on a project that was supposed
to take 8.  I'm sure some LF folks will read this and chuckle,
but it was an emotional technical journey that I'm glad I took.
As arduous as it was, it feels strangely pleasurable to get sucked
into a project like that, and I learned a whole lot about Drupal.
This doesn't really reflect LF at all, but I guess can be
taken as a lesson regarding how great interviews can be regardless
of whether you get the job?  Or something.  I just thought you
all should know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="puppet"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Puppet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't go on about how much I enjoyed
interviewing at Puppet. I interned there the previous summer, so
much of that enjoyment was in seeing old friends and getting
lots of hugs. I also know that raving about stuff sounds
cheesy and fake like squeezy cheese, and this blog post is
not about squeezy cheese. Barf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puppet's interview was 6 45-minute interviews, each with 2
engineers from the team I would be working on, and including
a one-on-one lunch.  The interviews were pretty standard stuff
(tell us about yourself, answer technical questions, etc.), but
in interviewing my interviewers it was clear that Puppet
prioritized &lt;em&gt;having a life&lt;/em&gt; outside of work. Most people had
kids, and everyone had a variety of hobbies as well, from
motorcycling to painting to construction and so on.  I know
work-life balance isn't a key word for everyone, but
for me personally it was a huge relief to know that I wouldn't be
expected to work 60-80 hours/week and could pursue other
interests after hours.  Puppet 100%
won on diversity as well, with a wide variety of races, ages,
and gender non-binary interviewers.  All in all, it was
a really fun day, and cemented for me that Puppet was
the right place for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll emphasize again that I'm very biased, particularly since
I accepted the job at Puppet and had worked there previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started looking for a job in mid-November and accepted the
position at Puppet mid-March. Finding a job is &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;, even
as a fully-qualified, young, white woman with years of
previous work experience.  Not only is it hard to get an offer,
but it's hard to research companies you're interested in, optimize
your resume, apply, hope, schedule calls, take time between
classes talking to recruiters and engineers for hourse, fly or drive
offsite for a full day of interviews, hear &amp;quot;We're sorry but...&amp;quot; over
and over and over. I have to admit that I was expecting the
interview process to take time, but underestimated how much energy
and emotion and effort it would take.  I've learned a lot about
the job market, about what I value and need in a career, and
about where I stand in comparison with my peers. But I'm
also thrilled with where I landed, and could not be
more excited to start working at Puppet this summer. I
wish anyone reading this before job searching good luck,
and hope that your experiences are enlightening if not
fruitful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, remember:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don't get a position, it's not &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; fault.
I interview candidates for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://osuosl.org"&gt;OSU Open Source Lab&lt;/a&gt;
and most of the time a candidate is well-suited to the
position, but there's just someone else we think would be
a little bit better.  It's not personal, it's not mean,
it's not that you're not good enough. It's not &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think about your values, and whether a company aligns with
them. It's so tempting to just go for prestige: Google, Apple,
Intel, etc. But if you're not crazy about how that company
operates, or what it makes, you don't want to spend years
working there.  Do your research, and &lt;em&gt;know what you want&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies want the same thing you do: for this to be a good
fit! If they don't think it is, then maybe they're right:
maybe it's not the right place for you.  Find a company
that's stoked to bring you on board!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With so many applications out there, it's difficult to discern which are
valuable, usable, and do what you expect them to.  So, for the sake
of those like me, here are some of the applications I have found
particularly useful or entertaining. I should also mention that these are
all free and available on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://multco.lib.overdrive.com"&gt;Overdrive&lt;/a&gt;: You can connect overdrive to local libraries and checkout
books to read or listen to on mobile. I use it to download and listen to
audiobooks, and honestly went from reading 0 books/year to about 1/week.
It's completely changed my life, and made the mundane moments like doing
laundry or walking to class more entertaining.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.danoeh.antennapod&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;AntennaPod&lt;/a&gt;: Similar to Overdrive, this app brings you great listening
material in a different form: podcasts.  It has lots of fancy features now
like adjustable playback speed, automatic deletion once you've listened
to an episode, and turning off if you fall asleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=another.music.player&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Shuttle&lt;/a&gt;: This is just a music player I'm happy with. If you're happy
with your music player, I wouldn't worry about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.headsup&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Heads up&lt;/a&gt;: This a fun &amp;quot;We're waiting for something and need to pass
the time&amp;quot; app. It's especially great with kids.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mint&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Mint&lt;/a&gt;: I use this mostly to set and maintain budgets. You need to give it
some very personal banking information, so if you're not into that this isn't
for you, but if you are I've found it very useful. You can even see your
credit score on it, which is always good to know!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.duolingo.com/"&gt;Duolingo&lt;/a&gt;: You've more than likely already heard of this, but if not
it's an addictive, gamified way of learning new languages.&lt;/li&gt;

We all do. The series has become an empire, with it's own movie series
and theme park, and no matter what subset of Harry Potter related
media you've experienced you have some thoughts about it. Regardless
of what those notions are -- good, bad, or ugly -- read on!  I have
had my own preconceptions about HP at various points in my life, and
after re-reading all seven books right in a row I can tell you that
many of them were turned upside down.  It may not be the series for
you, but before you go invest time in reading it, you may as well read
this way shorter blog post about it so you know what you're getting
into at least a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="preconceptions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Preconceptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many twenty-somethings, Harry Potter was the series of my
adolescence, and I grew up with Harry, Ron, and Hermione. I stood in
line for six hours to get the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th books, dressed as
a wizard and talking to other HP fans. I went to the midnight premier
of at least three of the movies.  I wasn't the most into it of all my
friends, but I drank the Kool-Aid. However, as I picked up the first
book again a few months ago I wasn't expecting Harry Potter to be a
great series.  I expected that they would be perfectly adequate tween
novels that I had loved in my youth but now, older and wiser, would
realize I had outgrown, like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Jackson_%26_the_Olympians"&gt;Percy Jackson&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.neopets.com"&gt;Neopets&lt;/a&gt;.  I'll get
to the chase you know is coming, reader: Harry Potter is not just a
kids book.  The characters are what make these books extraordinary, as
they are all layered, multidimensional, &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; people who reflect
modern society so well.  JK Rowling is able to capture the many ways
we judge other humans in her characters, and the lengths we'll go to
defend those judgements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-series"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Series&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the series is seven novels long, in reality it's one story
spanning seven years, that you do have to read in order and all of.
This isn't &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Ark"&gt;Animal Ark&lt;/a&gt; people.  There's no picking one book and
saying &amp;quot;Read this and you've read them all&amp;quot;.  That said, &lt;em&gt;it's 100%
worth it&lt;/em&gt;.  And I will say, some of the books are better than others.
My personal favorite was &amp;quot;The Half-Blood Prince&amp;quot;, but there is no
weak-link in the set, or book I finished and thought &amp;quot;Man, I really
hope the next one is better&amp;quot;. &lt;strong&gt;TL;DR Yes you have to read them all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-i-loved"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I loved&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Characters&lt;/strong&gt;. Growing up, all I remember is hating Snape. I had
no recollection of what an incredible character he is, so painfully
human and deeply entangled in the story.  The Malfoys, the Weasleys,
each delicately balanced between family and principles, conflicted
in how to choose what's best for those they love. So. Good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The HP Universe&lt;/strong&gt;.  JK Rowlings universe is very well thought out,
with details like government policy, racial prejudices, and even
the &lt;em&gt;botany&lt;/em&gt; of the universe created from scratch and implemented
perfectly.  Percy stresses about regulating cauldron-bottoms to be
thick enough. Neville knows the properties of Gillyweed and Devil's Snare.
History class is boring, standardized tests are stressful, and
non-wizards, muggle-born wizards, and women are all placed in a
social hierarchy similar to the racial strata that exists today.
The detail and consistency here is incredible, and makes the magical
world of Harry Potter that much more immersive and &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Form&lt;/strong&gt;.  Did you ever notice that there are no swear words in
Harry Potter?  And no modern technology more recent than a telephone or
TV, despite that these were written as iphones and laptops were
being developed and changing the world. It's executed so well that
you don't even notice.  There are prominent and powerful women,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Themes&lt;/strong&gt;. Rowling uses Harry Potter to explore coming of age,
racism and the hatred that arises from misunderstanding, corrupt
politics, greed, the psychology of abusive relationships, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's timeless&lt;/strong&gt;.  My second time through I feel as though I've barely scratched the
surface of deriving meaning from this series, and the layers of
complexity make this an excellent book for readers of all ages
and stages of life. I love that the series grows with you, taking
on new meaning each time it's revisited, and it makes me so excited
to read the series again in the future and see how it changes.  The
technology (or lack thereof) also adds to this timelessness, and
even a hundred years from now the books will still be just as relevant
and relatable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've made it this far: you know how I feel.  If you have any
questions, comments, or concerns, please email me at

them better than others.  I decided to get one because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I didn't want to be scared of permanently changing my body.&lt;/strong&gt;  We
make decisions that permanently alter the course of our life pretty
often, in much bigger ways than a tattoo will, and I know I will
regret coming to the end of my life with no permanent marks.  I
have scars and birthmarks, it seemed it was time to make a mark
that I got to dictate, that represented some aspect of myself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's a profoundly human experience&lt;/strong&gt;, and in general I like to
experience things other humans have in order to feel as though I've
lived my life to its fullest.  There are obvious lines I don't
cross (ie. heroin), but even the process of deciding on a design
and getting it has taught me a lot.  If you don't believe me, try
it out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wanted to think long and hard about my life up to this point,
and find the parts that mattered the most.&lt;/strong&gt;  Of course, there's no
need to get a tattoo in order to do this.  However, I'm about to
graduate from college and begin The Rest Of My Life,  and for me
personally a tattoo seems as good a way as any to mark this turning
point in my life and attempt to encapsulate the last 21 years into
something permanent that I can carry with me going forward. This
isn't to say that I can be boiled down into a single image or
phrase and have that put on my body, but it is to say that there
are some key points to represent symbolically that can help
solidify my identity at this point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They can be beautiful, and start conversations.&lt;/strong&gt; Nuff said.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with these intentions in mind, I set about getting a tattoo. In
some ways it was much easier than expected, in that there is a local
tattoo parlor that does high-quality work and is very safe. But on the
whole it wasn't exactly easy, as permanently changing your body using
needles probably shouldn't be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="choosing-a-design"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Choosing a Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted the tattoo to be small, simple, and something I knew I wasn't
likely to regret.  It needed to represent some part of myself that
wasn't liable to change, and that I wouldn't be embarrassed to talk
about.  With this criteria in mind I had a few ideas of things that my
tattoo could be &amp;quot;about&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portland, OR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something very generic + symbolic (ie. an equals sign)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was wary of quotes, as they seemed less pliable in their meaning,
and seemed more likely to &amp;quot;tire out&amp;quot; so to speak.  Besides, if I
really liked a quote, I had plenty of skin to get other tattoos in the
future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researching designs brought up a few contenders:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-left"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/equal-tattoo.jpg" style="width: 30%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/sun-watercolor.jpg" style="width: 30%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/rose-tattoo.jpg" style="width: 30%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After consulting friends and learning more about what kinds of tattoos
are difficult to execute, and which aren't, I settled on this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/my-tattoo.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the portland, in plain black ink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go small at first! You have plenty of space to get bigger ones later,
and you'll know what you're getting yourself into.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get line art.  This limits what you can get quite a bit, but again
line art is so much easier to get, and you'll almost definitely be happier
with the finally product. You can always work your way up to large, colored
tats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go with as few colors as possible.  Colors just add time, complexity,
and money to the tattoo.  It doesn't have to be black and white, but
if you can turn your design into black and white and still love it,
it's much easier!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="getting-the-tattoo"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting the Tattoo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually getting my tattoo was easy and relatively painless. I had a
super brief consultation with the local parlor to get some questions
answered and show them my design, then made an appointment for a few
days later.  The only advice I received about prepping for getting the
tattoo was pretty solid life advice: drink lots of water, eat a good
healthy meal before, get enough sleep.  Standard stuff. I got to my
appointment &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; early (like, half an hour early) because I was so
nervous, and spent the time filling out some paperwork and pacing.  My
boyfriend came with me, which was very helpful. It was great not just
to have support there, but someone to talk to and experience this
with.  I said it was fine if he didn't come, but in retrospect I would
not want to get a tattoo alone. So, around 7 the tattoo artist set up
the table, showed me her rendering of the design, and then did this
cool paper-to-skin thing so you could basically see how the tattoo was
going to look before getting inked.  It looked great, so we got
started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My tattoo is on my ribs, which regular tattoo-getters will tell you is
among the more painful spots since it's so close to bone.  It
definitely wasn't comfortable, but my tattoo was so small and simple
that it wasn't painful so much as annoying. It feels like someone is
rubbing the tip of a needle on your skin, not like it's &lt;em&gt;cutting&lt;/em&gt; you,
but just lightly scratch.  If you have a really sharp pencil, you can
try drawing on your skin, and that's about how it feels.  My tattoo
took about 10 minutes from start to finish, and with my beau to keep
me distracted it went by pretty quick.  My tattoo artist was also
incredibly sweet, understanding, and supportive, and made the whole
experience that much more pleasant. Once it was done, I took a look to
make sure it all looked good.  I won't get too cheesy, but it was love
at first sight. As anyone is with their first tattoo, I was nervous
that I would regret getting something put permanently on my body, but
I knew when I saw it that I had made the right decision. Crisis:
avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/my-tat-picture.jpeg" style="width: 40%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="post-tattoo"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Post-tattoo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super cool tattoo lady hooked me up with some tattoo-care products for
totally reasonable and worth-it prices, including a nice soap and
lotion.  Since my tattoo was so small and minimal it never hurt,
turned red, itched, or any of the other possible skin irritation that
often come after getting a tattoo.  I even forgot I had one the next
day, and as I was getting ready for bed thought &amp;quot;OH MY GOD WHAT
HAPPENED oh right I got a tattoo&amp;quot;.  The lesson: start small!  It's
been 100% painless as long as you take good care of it.  It's been
exactly 1 week since I got it as of this writing, and by now it feels
like a completely normal and natural part of my body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I'm very happy with my tattoo, and the decision to get it.
There are totally unexpected side effects of empowerment, and my
tattoo is not just a reminder of where I come from but that my body is
&lt;em&gt;mine&lt;/em&gt;, and that I get to choose what happens to it. I have to admit
that my parents explicitly didn't approve of my getting one, and I was
really hurt that they wouldn't support me.  I understand that as
parents their job is to keep me safe and avoid regrettable decisions,
which a tattoo very well could be. But (as is hopefully evidenced by
this post!) I put a lot of thought and care into getting one, and wish
that they had been more understanding.  Luckily, it's not very
visible, so no one &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to know.  Even if they do find out (probably
through this post), it's my body! Yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm thrilled that I can carry a piece of my childhood with me into
adulthood now, and know what it's like to be tattooed.  It's almost
like being part of a club, and has already sparked some very
interesting and intimate conversations with co-workers and friends
about their tattoos, and how they decided to get them.  I'm not sure
what the best way to end this post is, but I hope it's been helpful |
insightful | interesting! Have an excellent day :)&lt;/p&gt;

great blood pressure, a healthy heart rate, and can walk way farther and longer
than my brother or I (seriously, bring comfortable walking shoes if you
ever go on vacation with us. Lessons learned the hard way.).  In fact,
a few years ago my mom had her gallbladder removed, came home and

prioritizing intellect and personality over looks, to
emphasizing exercise and good food, my mom built an ideal body-image
foundation.  This isn't to say I've always had a healthy
relationship with food, but it's been easy to develop one.  I'm
so grateful to my mom for helping me see that your waistline
doesn't indicate how healthy you are, that big hispanic booties
are a great ass-et, and that exercising and eating to feel good
will make me way happeir (and healthier) than dieting ever will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.carriebrownstein.com/"&gt;Carrie Brownstein&lt;/a&gt;. Brownstein's memoir of her
time in the band &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sleater-kinney.com/"&gt;Sleater-Kinney&lt;/a&gt;, this book was raw to the point
of discomfort. Whatever opinions I may have, they're outweighed
by the respect I have for Brownstein's openness, vulnerability, and honesty.
The whole book, beginning to end, is one long intimate passage into
the private lives of herself, her family, and her bandmates, sharing
details I would cringe to tell my own friends, let alone publish
for the world to read. More than anything I'm in awe of her
talent for writing and fearless storytelling.  After the
amazement at her baring-all, though, I had a few other thoughts
on the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went in with few expectations and
scattered knowledge of Carrie Brownstein. I knew from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/"&gt;All Songs Considered&lt;/a&gt;
that she was a member of Sleater-Kinney, that she had worked briefly
for that podcast, and of course knew about her role in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ifc.com/shows/portlandia"&gt;Portlandia&lt;/a&gt;.
But I had never listened to Sleater-Kinney's music, much less studied their
past or had any part in the Pacific Northwest punk scene. In hindsight,
doing a little bit of studying before hand would have been helpful --
the book catalogs her experiences before, during, and briefly after
Sleater-Kinney exclusively, and she frequently references bands and
events I had never heard of, despite being so geographically and
temporally close to them.  This was a bug and a feature: knowing so
little made the book more educational, interesting, and worthwhile,
but also in many ways less meaningful or impactful for me personally.
That said, Brownstein includes so much more than just a history of
the band.  Her struggles with anxiety and depression, a variety
of physical conditions including shingles and an allergy to soy,
and hypochondria while touring with a band, are very much relatable
to any who has battled those same battles. She also speaks at length
of coming of age and finding what she wanted to do, of how her parents
own repressed selves affected her childhood, and of other
profound thoughts on the human experience in the modern age, and how
to navigate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, &amp;quot;Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl&amp;quot; was an enjoyable
and worthwhile read. Entertaining, insightful, and almost unbearably
honest, I would highly recommend picking this up if you have a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

One by Ernest Cline&lt;/a&gt;.  Set 30 years in the future, Ready Player One
depicts a bleak distopia where a MMORPG (massively multiplayer online
role playing game) called the OASIS is the only escape from reality,
and has in fact replaced it.  The novel follows teenager Wade Watts
through a Hunger Games-esque competition requiring expansive and
detailed knowledge of 80's tech culture, from video games to movies to
comic books and beyond.  This is a total candy read, and if you're
into science fiction or Neal Stephenson novels (particularly
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Reamde-A-Novel-Neal-Stephenson/dp/0062191497"&gt;Reamde&lt;/a&gt;), this would definitely be a good weekend pick-me-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, it didn't hit my literary sweet spot, but then again I
can't say I expected it to. I will say it was much more accessible
than I expected it to be, and aligned perfectly with my values:
intellect winning out over money; strong, rich, diverse characters;
well researched but not obscure.  Candy Read.  Without giving too much
away (fear not, read on), what made it most enjoyable was the very
distinct Good vs. Evil dynamic, and how each party was very clearly on
one side or the other. It was easy to root for the the protagonists,
against the antagonists, and just be along for the plot-ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's all she wrote.  My next review will be sometime next week
on Carrie Brownstein's memoir &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Hunger-Makes-Me-Modern-Girl/dp/1594486638"&gt;Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deb Nicholson, &lt;strong&gt;The Foss Awakens&lt;/strong&gt;. How collaboration and mentoring
are a force for good, told with Star Wars images. Grade-A speaker, definitely
delivered. Great way to start the evening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gilbert Standen, &lt;strong&gt;Building Oracle on LXC&lt;/strong&gt;. He lost me at &amp;quot;Oracle&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Me. &lt;strong&gt;Rocking the House&lt;/strong&gt;.  But seriously, people laughed at my jokes,
I got high-fived, it went better than expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dave Nielsen, &lt;strong&gt;Redis&lt;/strong&gt;. Kind of informative, kind of boring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emily Dunham, &lt;strong&gt;Where's the Cloud&lt;/strong&gt;. Much like Deb, Emily is a veteran
speaker and it shows. Funny, informative, ended on a pun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don Marti, &lt;strong&gt;Web ads&lt;/strong&gt;. I would have appreciated it more if I was less sleepy
I think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Justin King, &lt;strong&gt;Choosing a Framework for your project&lt;/strong&gt;. Knowledgable and
well spoken, it's pretty great to watch a not-adult give a talk.  They have
great perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corey Quinn: &lt;strong&gt;Docker Must Die: Heresy in the Church of Docker&lt;/strong&gt;. So, so
funny. Dude is a master.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some good laughs, I headed back up to my room, realized how
overwhelmingly underprepared I was for my talk, finished up my slides and hit
the hay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="day-1"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 1:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woke up early and got breakfast at this adorable bakery, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/euro-pane-bakery-pasadena"&gt;Euro Pane&lt;/a&gt;.
Ran through the talk once for good measure, then headed over to the Key Note,
by Mark Shuttleworth. Honestly, it was pretty much a sales pitch, and I
wasn't really into it. But at least I didn't feel bad leaving early. I headed
over to my room, set everything up, then walked around to get out the nerves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="my-talk"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My Talk&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://slides.lucywyman.me/modifying-the-kernel.html"&gt;Modifying the Kernel: A How-to&lt;/a&gt;
Not my best, not my worst. I got across the information I wanted to, and got
lots of positive feedback after the talk and throughout the day. More than
anything, I'm relieved that it's over and I can cross it off of my
to-do list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="lunch"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lunch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had guacamole, made tableside. It was &lt;em&gt;bomb&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="keila-banks-automated-teen"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keila Banks, Automated Teen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was really excited for this talk, and was a little let down. Between mic
issues, some nerves, and being a little out of touch with the conference,
I didn't get what I wanted to out of the talk.  All of that said, I have a
lot of respect for Keila giving a talk to such a big room, and for getting up
there in the first place. I'm excited to see what she does in the future, and
hope to see her at other Open Source conferences soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="justin-mayer-essential-linux-security"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Justin Mayer, Essential Linux Security&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was pretty nearly the perfect talk.  I learned about a lot of valuable
tools, including changes you can make to your SSH configs, creating SSL
certificates with Let's Encrypt, HSTS, CSP, and other tools to make my
computer and websites safer.  In Justin's words, &amp;quot;Think of the children&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check out his slides at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://justinmayer.com/talks/server-security/#/"&gt;https://justinmayer.com/talks/server-security/#/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="brandon-philips-etcd"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Brandon Philips, Etcd&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also a great talk. Brandon is obviously a well-practiced speaker who
seemed very comfortable on stage.  He's also incredibly knowledgeable, and it
was clear that this talk was only skimming the surface of what he knows on
the subject of etcd. I also didn't know very much about etcd or CoreOS going
in to the talk -- I even thought the d was for daemon :p -- so stood to get
a lot out of it. And I did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see some of the demos he did at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/philips/hacks/tree/master/etcd-demos"&gt;https://github.com/philips/hacks/tree/master/etcd-demos&lt;/a&gt;,
or learn more about CoreOS at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://coreos.com/"&gt;https://coreos.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="day-2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 2:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning was absolutely &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt; in Pasadena.  I got to walk around
for a while before everyone else woke up, and soak in some Sunday Morning
magic. I don't know. There's something about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="keynote-sarah-sharp-on-diversity"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keynote: Sarah Sharp on Diversity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said a lot of really important things, but they're also things that everyone
has heard before.  She knows her stuff, and seems very passionate, but that
keynote isn't going to change anything.  Call me a cynic, but from the two
guys behind me asking &amp;quot;Why should minorities get a stipend just for getting an
internship?&amp;quot; to ethnic homogeneity of the audience, I don't hold much hope
for tech companies realizing how important diversity of their workforce is
any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="randal-schwartz-intro-to-dart"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Randal Schwartz, Intro to Dart&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I spent this whole talk just working on making this blog. Woops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="other-things-i-saw-today"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other Things I Saw Today&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two pugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three grown men yell group hug and execute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the rest of the day doing homework and travelling. It's amazing how
much effort it takes to move a human from A to B, and I have to say I was
so exhausted by the time we got to Corvallis around 12:30.  Lesson learned:
I am not a Sunday-worker. Sundays are for blankets and tea and tv, not
late night flights and talking to other humans.  Overall, SCaLE was
less stressful than I thought it would be, and I don't regret going
like I thought I would. Maybe that sounds lukewarm, and I have to say
it is a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; well run conference, and my particular sentiments don't
reflect a lack of effort on the part of the organizers,
presenters, or exhibitors. Objectively, it's a great conference.  I'm
not really sure how to end this post. I might think of something
better later. For now, ciao gentle reader. You excellent human you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
