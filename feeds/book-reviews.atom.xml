&lt;dt&gt;if (you haven't read this book):&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;You should at the very least give the first book a try. It's a quick read,
and you can give up or keep going from there.  This series is iconic for
a reason, and whether you're just starting 5th grade or getting ready to
retire the series was written for you.  Of course it's not everybody's
cup of tea, but don't think you've missed the boat, or that this is a
childrens book: trust me it's one for the ages (pun intended).&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;elif (you haven't read the series in a decade):&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;It's worth revisiting.  Maybe not at the top of the to-read list, but
if you've got space in your book schedule and don't remember the details
of Harry's escapades, I found re-reading the series incredibly rewarding.
There  were so many nuances and&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
