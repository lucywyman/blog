to deploy your application to (think Heroku, Google App Engine, or AWS
Beanstalk). They have a tool called &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.1/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build"&gt;Source 2 Image (S2I)&lt;/a&gt; that
allows you to pass in a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/builds/index.html"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; (in the form of a docker image, git
repo, or binary) and then builds an Openshift docker image from that.
Because I'm using this as a project for work, and my application
already lives on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to use a private Git repo as my
source for deploying my application to Openshift. Deploying public Git
repos is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/application_lifecycle/new_app.html#specifying-source-code"&gt;well-documented&lt;/a&gt;, and while private repos don't require too
much additional setup there were a few hiccups along the road, and no
great step-by-step resource. So...I decided to write my own!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="notes"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id2"&gt;Notes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This assumes that you already know &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://developers.openshift.com/"&gt;what Openshift is&lt;/a&gt;, and have some basic Git and web application knowledge. I essentially wrote what I wish I had read 2 days ago -- if there's any context you're missing I've tried to provide as many resources I think would be useful at the end of this article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This also assumes you're on Linux, and I am far too lazy to find how to do all of this on other systems. If these don't work on OSX or Windows, maybe you should consider a different operating system?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="overview"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id3"&gt;Overview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="contents topic" id="contents"&gt;
&lt;p class="topic-title first"&gt;Contents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="#notes" id="id2"&gt;Notes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="#overview" id="id3"&gt;Overview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="#install-the-openshift-cli" id="id4"&gt;Install the Openshift CLI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="#create-an-openshift-project" id="id5"&gt;Create an Openshift project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="#pause" id="id6"&gt;Pause&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="#create-an-ssh-key" id="id7"&gt;Create an SSH Key&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="#add-public-key-as-a-deploy-key-to-repo" id="id8"&gt;Add Public Key as a Deploy Key to Repo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="#add-key-as-a-secret-to-openshift" id="id9"&gt;Add Key as a Secret to Openshift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="#create-openshift-application" id="id10"&gt;Create Openshift Application&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="#make-sure-it-worked" id="id11"&gt;Make Sure It Worked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="#issues-i-ran-in-to" id="id12"&gt;Issues I Ran In To&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="#the-wrong-git-uri" id="id13"&gt;The Wrong Git URI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="#application-already-exists" id="id14"&gt;Application Already Exists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="#resources" id="id15"&gt;Resources&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="install-the-openshift-cli"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openshift.org/latest/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html#cli-linux"&gt;Install the Openshift CLI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 0 is to install the Openshift CLI. I generally find CLIs easier
to use + understand, but Openshift also has a nice GUI you can use
if you'd prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: this assumes that you already have access to and Openshift
instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases#Downloads"&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Untar &lt;code&gt;tar -xvzf openshift-origin-client-tools-v1.5.1-7b451fc-linux-64bit.tar.gz&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move binary into path &lt;code&gt;mv openshift-origin-client-tools-v1.5.1-7b451fc-linux-64bit/oc /usr/local/bin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: If you're not sure what's in your path, run &lt;code&gt;echo $PATH&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="create-an-openshift-project"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Create an &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/projects.html"&gt;Openshift project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where our applications, builds, etc. will live. I highly
recommend running &lt;code&gt;oc new-project -h&lt;/code&gt; first to see if there are
any flags or arguments you want to pass in! I just ran &lt;code&gt;oc
new-project &amp;lt;project-name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pause"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id6"&gt;Pause&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop right here! Usually, the tutorials will tell you to make your
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://developers.openshift.com/managing-your-applications/creating-applications.html"&gt;Openshift application&lt;/a&gt; next and pass in your Git URL. DON'T FALL FOR
IT. The problem is that for private repos, you need to have a deploy
key so Openshift can authenticate with the repo. However, the only way
to tell Openshift it needs the SSH key is in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/builds/index.html#defining-a-buildconfig"&gt;buildconfig&lt;/a&gt;. And
the buildconfig isn't generated until you either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to create an application (the first build will fail then you can
modify the buildconfig) OR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a template (basically write your own reusable buildconfig).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up using a template, because it drove me nuts to have the
first build of the application fail. But you can see a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.openshift.com/using-ssh-key-for-s2i-builds/"&gt;step-by-step
guide for option 1 here&lt;/a&gt;
if you'd prefer to modify an existing buildconfig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="create-an-ssh-key"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id7"&gt;Create an SSH Key&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so, adding a deploy key to both our Github and Openshift. First things
first, lets make a special key (Don't use your own personal SSH key!
Make a new one!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C &amp;quot;openshift-key&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Make sure you give it a unique path, so that it doesn't
overwrite any existing SSH key(s)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="add-public-key-as-a-deploy-key-to-repo"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id8"&gt;Add Public Key as a Deploy Key to Repo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we'll add the public key to our private Git repo as a deploy key,
so that it can verify communications with Openshift. See Git's
slightly more helpful documentation on how to do this &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#deploy-keys"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the repos main page in Github&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the 'Settings' tab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to 'Deploy keys'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give it a name (can be anything)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paste the &lt;strong&gt;public&lt;/strong&gt; key (&lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/id_rsa-openshift.pub&lt;/code&gt;) into the textbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click add key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="add-key-as-a-secret-to-openshift"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id9"&gt;Add Key as a Secret to Openshift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have to give Openshift the private key, and make it an
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/dev_guide/secrets.html"&gt;Openshift secret&lt;/a&gt;. Openshift secrets &amp;quot;decouple sensitive content
from the pods that use it and can be mounted into containers using a
volume plug-in or used by the system to perform actions on behalf of a
pod&amp;quot;, which is very useful!  Creating them requires a few steps (read
more about why in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.openshift.com/deploying-from-private-git-repositories/"&gt;this poorly named blog post&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;oc secrets new-sshauth openshiftkey --ssh-privatekey=$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa-openshift
oc secrets add serviceaccount/builder secrets/openshiftkey
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you accidentally add the public key like I did, you can remove
secrets using &lt;code&gt;oc delete secret openshiftkey&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="create-openshift-application"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id10"&gt;Create Openshift Application&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; that our keys are all squared away, we can create an
application using a private git repo as our source! Unfortunately,
there's currently no way to use the &lt;code&gt;oc new-app&lt;/code&gt; command
directly to build an image from a private repo. What we'll do instead
is create an &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/templates.html"&gt;application template&lt;/a&gt; that includes the necessary
secret and use that template to create our app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Create a template for our git repo using the new-app command&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;oc new-app ssh://git@github.com:mygituser/mygitrepo --name app-name -o json &amp;gt;&amp;gt; my-template.json
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Open the JSON file and change &amp;quot;List&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Template&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;items&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;objects&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Add a &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;my-app-name&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;metadata&lt;/code&gt; object&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;quot;metadata&amp;quot;: {&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;my-app-name&amp;quot;},
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;This part is tricky and I'm not sure how best to describe it, but in &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;spec&amp;quot;: {&amp;quot;source&amp;quot;:{}}&lt;/code&gt; object add&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;quot;sourceSecret&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;openshiftkey&amp;quot;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you should end up with a block that looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;foo bar baz
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/lucywyman/145aebfe1897d91d4cd5337e5baa7379"&gt;This is what my JSON template ended up looking like&lt;/a&gt; (with sensitive
information removed)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Create a template based on this json file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;oc create -f my-template.json
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Finally, create an application using the template!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;oc new-app --template app-name
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I highly recommend you run &lt;code&gt;oc new-app -h&lt;/code&gt; first to see if there are any special configurations you want to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="make-sure-it-worked"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id11"&gt;Make Sure It Worked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;oc get builds&lt;/code&gt;, and you should see output similar to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;NAME      TYPE      FROM          STATUS     STARTED        DURATION
my-app1   Source    Git@abcdefg   Complete   18 hours ago   29s
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="issues-i-ran-in-to"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id12"&gt;Issues I Ran In To&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-wrong-git-uri"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id13"&gt;The Wrong Git URI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I was using the http Git URI, which obviously didn't use
the SSH deploy key. I then tried using
&lt;code&gt;ssh://git&amp;#64;github.com:my-user/my-repo.git&lt;/code&gt;, which also failed.
&lt;code&gt;git&amp;#64;github.com:my-user/my-repo.git&lt;/code&gt; is the right URI!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="application-already-exists"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id14"&gt;Application Already Exists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I had to try building my application several times, I also had
to delete my failed attempts several times so there wouldn't be name
errors. I usually ran the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;oc delete services --all
oc delete deploymentconfig --all
oc delete buildconfig --all
oc delete imagestreams --all
oc delete templates --all
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This obviously won't work if you have services you're trying to
preserve, but you can just specify which services etc. to delete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="resources"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id15"&gt;Resources&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openshift.org/latest/welcome/index.html"&gt;Openshift Origin&lt;/a&gt; documentation was invaluable in
troubleshooting various issues I had&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I asked a question in #openshift on irc, and someone answered within
5 minutes and was very nice and helpful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://openshift.com/promotions/for-developers.html"&gt;Free E-Book&lt;/a&gt; (pdf format too) call &amp;quot;Openshift for
Developer's&amp;quot; that explains more about what Openshift is and how it
works. This was super helpful for understanding what all of the
components were, and generally getting started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

dreaming of days spent in a park, beside a pool, or on a beach with a good
book in hand. Here's what I've been reading + loving:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="kitchens-of-the-great-midwest"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23398625-kitchens-of-the-great-midwest"&gt;Kitchens of the Great Midwest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By J. Ryan Stradal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="static/kitchens-of-the-great-midwest4.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kitchens of the Great Midwest is just about the sweetest book.
Following the life of Eva Thorvald through the eyes of those around her,
this book details the joys and pains of growing up in the midwest. Filled
with food and a kindness only midwesterners can muster, KotGM is the
perfect compliment to sunshine and lazy days in the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-everything-became-war-and-the-military-became-everything"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29238798-how-everything-became-war-and-the-military-became-everything"&gt;How Everything Became War, and the Military Became Everything&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Rosa Brooks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="static/how-everything-became-war.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite it's tongue-twisting title, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29238798-how-everything-became-war-and-the-military-became-everything"&gt;How Everything Became War, and
the Military Became Everything&lt;/a&gt; might be the best book I read all
year. The military has never been part of my family or culture, yet as
an American has tremendous impact on my life. A former Pentagon
reporter, Rosa Brooks brings incredible insight into the current state
of the military, and how it got to where it is. What influence does it
yield? Why? What are the consequences of that? I learned &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt;
reading this book, and like all the best books it gave me new
perspective and understanding of the world we live in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-magnolia-story"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28668633-the-magnolia-story"&gt;The Magnolia Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Chip and Joanna Gaines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I know I know I know I know. Judge all you want, I am
head-over-heels for Chip and Joanna Gaines, and their book did not
disappoint. They're so funny! And cute!  Perfect for beach reading and
flower gazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-bell-jar"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28668633-the-magnolia-story"&gt;The Bell Jar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Sylvia Plath&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bell Jar flat out surprised me. I think of it as Classic Literature,
and often find that Classic Literature is too masculine or too opaque for
my casual reading tastes. This book was anything but! Plath's
semi-autobiographical novel is the beautiful story of a young woman trying
to find her&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="beautiful-ruins"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11447921-beautiful-ruins"&gt;Beautiful Ruins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Jess Walter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to conceive of a book that successfully explores so many characters,
time periods, locations, and relationships in a cohesive story. But Walter is
able to take us from the Italian coast in the 1960's to modern day Hollywood to
the middle of nowhere Idaho without muddling the story or confusing the reader.
Rich characters, interesting plot, and Hollywood glamour make this a delightful

I don't like the
idea of have-to's or should's, but I do like the idea of heading into the
summer with answers to the question &amp;quot;What should we do on this beautiful day?&amp;quot;.
Many of these are time-honored traditions in my family, so this is more of a
reminder to partake than an aspirational list. Nonetheless, it bears writing
and checking in. Here's what we're planning on doing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.vmacpdx.com/salsa.html"&gt;Salsa class&lt;/a&gt; (I'm already signed up!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://oakspark.com/"&gt;Oaks Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attend the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://oregonstatefair.org/"&gt;Oregon State Fair&lt;/a&gt; (and maybe submit a baked good...)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go berry picking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to Shakespeare in the Park in Seattle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a barbecue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to trivia night&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.lastthursdayonalberta.com/"&gt;Last Thursday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bake some bread. Yeast scares me, and I want to get over it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all! Short. Sweet. Doable. Makin' the most of those summer nights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of content in this post, including a lot of links to
even more content.  Here's the good stuff, if you want to skip the
gory details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="faq"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FAQ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How was OSCON?&lt;/strong&gt;
Overall, this was an excellent conference! I'm not sure if the quality
of speakers was especially high this year or if I'm just getting
better at choosing which talks to attend, but I was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; impressed
with the speakers and their topics. There were only 1 or 2
talks that weren't useful to me, and even then I didn't find myself
wishing I had attended a different talk. I learned a lot, got to catch
up with OSS nerd friends, and got to meet some fantastic folks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did your talk go?&lt;/strong&gt;
Very well! As the speaker it always feels like there are a million
little things you should have done differently (I should have
introduced this topic sooner, I should have defined this phrase, I
should have put my contact info &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt; in the slides, etc.). But
attendees were engaged and attentive throughout the presentation, lots
of people asked good questions, and those that I spoke to said they
had clear takeaways from the presentation. Could it have been better?
Definitely. Was it helpful to those who attended? Definitely. Looking
back I consider it a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you like Austin?&lt;/strong&gt;
Visiting Austin was also fun. As one of those people who is always
cold I love visiting warmer climates, even if it's overcast and muggy.
There was an abundance of good food (I'll take 3 fried avocado tacos
please thank you), cute parks and urban hiking, and fantastic street
art. There was also live music &lt;em&gt;at the airport&lt;/em&gt;. I was also visiting
with a friend who had already been in Austin for 2 weeks (for
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://austin.dreamhack.com/"&gt;DreamHack&lt;/a&gt;), and later with a friend who lives in Austin, both of
whom were tremendously helpful in navigating the city and it's many
attractions. Would I visit again for a vacation? Probably not at the
top of my list. But if OSCON &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to be somewhere other than
Portland, I definitely didn't mind it being in Austin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, on to the session I attended throughout the conference!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="wednesday"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="keynotes"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keynotes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="step-1-punch-a-tree"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx/public/schedule/detail/59367"&gt;Step 1: Punch a Tree&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was one of the most polished, entertaining, and well done talks
I've seen in a while. It packed a punch, and was put together without
being over the top. The &amp;quot;slides&amp;quot; were amazing (I had never seen slides
like that before, or even thought to do something similar), the videos
and sound effects were appropriate, well timed, and placed well
(again, without being over the top), and the message was a truly open
source and resonant one. Evan spoke about hardware hacking, and
advocated for general parts to be standardized and made
interchangeable like how batteries are now. For example, why can't we
have motors be widely available and easy to replace in everything from
toys to microwaves to blenders? An excellent and inspiring note to start on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="choose-open-infrastructure"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx/public/schedule/detail/61296"&gt;Choose Open Infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Christopher Aedo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another excellent keynote! Chris works for IBM, which at a conference
like OSCON tends to make the audience skeptical. Chris' talk was
anything but a product pitch though -- he spoke about how we can make
infrastructure (read: compute storage and networking) more open across
the industry. He spoke about the business benefits of using open
source, how to build or choose infra tools using 3 open source
principles, and listed common tools that met all 3 of those
principles. There was no mention of IBM, or even any projects or
products they were working on, just some hard core pro-open source
talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Open Source Principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency&lt;/strong&gt; - do they work openly?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interoperability&lt;/strong&gt; - can I get my data off the platform? Or am I locked in?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Influence&lt;/strong&gt; - do they listen to non-paying users?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="open-source-contribution-and-collaboration-how-and-why-netflix-drives-industry-engagement"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx/public/schedule/detail/59265"&gt;Open source contribution and collaboration: How (and why) Netflix drives industry engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Dianne Marsh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Dianne used Netflix project &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.spinnaker.io/"&gt;Spinnaker&lt;/a&gt; as a case study
for how to successfully collaborate with other companies, in the
context of open source. It was an interesting an insightful talk,
and made me hopeful that companies like Netflix will continue to do
open source right. Dianne also made some good points about how
to successfully collaborate (in this case across companies), notably:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build trust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to communicate effectively (whatever that means for your
specific team + companies)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Value input from everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't lose sight of your objective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is pretty standard advice, I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think that a project is
less likely to succeed without these. Overall, interesting but not
mind blowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx/public/schedule/detail/61737"&gt;The power of the open source ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Ying Xiong&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was awesome to see a non-US speaker on stage, and I definitely hope
to see more non-US based technologies, companies, and individuals
speaking at OSCON in the future! That said, I think this talk in
particular missed the mark. It was Huawei paying lip service to open
source with misspelled slides and no clear point besides an
unconvincing &amp;quot;Huawei supports open source&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx/public/schedule/detail/60576"&gt;Rebuilding trust through blockchains and open source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Brian Behlendorf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain"&gt;block chains&lt;/a&gt; are super cool, but this was a weird
keynote. Maybe that's only because I'm not used to business-y
keynotes, but this was 5 minute talk that included the phrase &amp;quot;This is
as exciting as when the internet was starting&amp;quot; and a plea to come to a
talk later that day. Mad respect to Brian, but I think this felt out
of place and insincere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx/public/schedule/detail/59364"&gt;Sharing America's code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Alvand Salehi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a very corny Don Draper giving this talk. Alvand is a
physically beautiful human who is, like, 5 years away from being a
really great speaker. But right now he is completely Over the Top. My
favorite quote from this talk was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'And then, they did something &lt;em&gt;even bolder&lt;/em&gt;: they open sourced their
project. It gives me chills just thinking about it'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of the talk was super interesting though. Alvand works for
the US government, and talked about &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://code.gov"&gt;code.gov&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://sourcecode.cio.gov/"&gt;Source Code
Policy&lt;/a&gt;, and other efforts within the government to promote open
source and deduplicate software usage throughout the government. He
talked specifically about &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/deptofdefense/anet"&gt;anet&lt;/a&gt;, a little tool to track which NATO
advisors have trained which Afghan officials, and spoke about the team
which led that project and what helped them succeed. It was honestly a
really good keynote, despite (or maybe including) the speaker's
hilarious exaggerations and style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="my-talk"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="#my-talk"&gt;My Talk!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First session Wednesday morning was my talk! First, I have to say that
I was bizarrely calm before giving my talk. The kind of nerves I get
are usually a very physical kind, where for the full hour before my talk
starts I'll have butterflies in my stomach, and sweaty palms, and
short breath. But this time none of that happened. &lt;em&gt;shrug&lt;/em&gt;. Maybe my
body is catching on that public speaking isn't scary? But about the
talk! It's so hard to have perspective about talks you give, and so my
initial reaction when people asked how it went was to say &amp;quot;Oh, there
were so many things I could have improved or done better&amp;quot;. For
example, I completely neglected to include any contact information or the link
to my slides in my presentation. But everyone I spoke to after the
talk, even those who had constructive feedback, told me that they had
really enjoyed the talk and had gotten something out of it. Overall
I'm reasonably pleased with how it went, have a list of notes to
myself for future versions of this talk, and sincerely hope that I was
able to make contributing to open source software a little less
intimidating for someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="finding-your-way-in-the-dark-security-from-first-principles"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx/public/schedule/detail/57236"&gt;Finding your way in the dark: Security from first principles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Susan Sons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you secure the equipment used to measure water movement below
ice floes? Or equipment taking measurements in a volcano? At the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.nsf.gov/"&gt;National Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, these are the kind of questions Susan
Sons is asked. This talk was really great for a few reasons:
1. It presented general lessons that anyone in the room could use
2. It also provided specific examples to illustrate how to apply those lessons.
3. It supported it's claims
4. Susan told interesting stories, and was clearly an incredibly competent and knowledgeable human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this is to say that talks without the above are bad, but I
think these things were at least part of what made Susan's talk an
incredibly successful one. I walked away with a new set of tools that
I could apply to my job (and likely future jobs), a full understanding
of how to use those tools, and more knowledge about &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae"&gt;Thermopylae&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susan talked about 7 principles that help guide and support decisions
about how to secure a wide variety of systems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comprehensivity&lt;/strong&gt; - Am I covering all my bases?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opportunity&lt;/strong&gt; - Am I taking advantage of my resources?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rigor&lt;/strong&gt; - What is correct behavior, how am I ensuring it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimization&lt;/strong&gt; - Can this be smaller?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compartmentalization&lt;/strong&gt; - Is this made of distinct parts with
limited interactions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fault Tolerance&lt;/strong&gt; - What happens if this fails?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proportionality&lt;/strong&gt; - Is it worth it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After introducing the principles, the rest of the talk used examples
to color in details on how to apply the principles and justify their
place in the list. If you have the time and are interested in
security, I highly highly recommend watching!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="enhancing-cloud-security-with-the-tpm"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx/public/schedule/detail/57075"&gt;Enhancing cloud security with the TPM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By James Bottomley&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another excellent talk! James talks at a mile a minute, though I was
lucky to know juuust enough background knowledge to be able to keep
up. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module"&gt;The TPM&lt;/a&gt; is a small chip that's used to securely generate,
store, and limit use of cryptographic keys. James talk was
about using the TPM to store cloud machine's secrets, specifically VPN keys and
potentially RSA keys. There are a number of stumbling blocks towards
this goal, not the least of which is a radical difference in how the
TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0 work (which makes backwards compatibility
difficult at best and impossible at worst). I had never heard of the
TPM before this talk, and while I can't say I fully grok how it might
be used in the future it certainly seems worth knowing more about and
keeping an eye on, in the context of security in the cloud! Definitely
worth a watch if you are mathematically or security inclined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="stephen-king-s-practical-advice-for-tech-writers"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx/public/schedule/detail/55872"&gt;Stephen King's practical advice for tech writers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Rikki Endsley&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll start by saying I adore Rikki. I've only met her a few times, but
she's always lovely, welcoming, and easy to talk to. She spoke about
tips for writing, most of which are relatively common knowledge but as
an occasional writer I found them both inspiring and helpful! It never
hurts to be reminded of how to structure your articles based on your
audience, have a clear point, and that the only way to get better at
writing is by writing. Rikki also provided a number of tech-industry
specific tips (how technical to be in various articles, for example),
as well as a number of quips from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/150292-on-writing-a-memoir-of-the-craft"&gt;Stephen King&lt;/a&gt; (kill your darlings,
kill your darlings). Although this was a &amp;quot;common knowledge&amp;quot; type
of talk, it's also the talk I got the most out of in the
whole conference, particularly since writing plays such an important
role in my job and life. I was reminded to edit my pieces (woops,
don't usually do that!), to learn to handle criticism, and to know who
I'm writing for. Overall, a super worthwhile and excellent talk from a
true expert (and open source hero!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before you write know what you are writing about, why you're writing, and who your reader is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research, outline, write, revise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 categories of audience in tech: lay audience, managers, experts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good writing requires lots of reading and writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have clear expectations for what your piece needs to deliver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invite the reader in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell a story&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave out the boring parts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include lists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To write is human, to edit is divine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kill your darlings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a brutally honest editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start writing!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-i-learned-to-stop-being-afraid-and-love-the-jvm"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx/public/schedule/detail/56563"&gt;How I learned to stop being afraid and love the JVM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By James Turnbull&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, if you're reading this post straight through, I know at this point
it might seem like I loved &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the talks I went to at OSCON,
which makes loving a talk feel cheap. Let me assure you that 1. This
is an anomaly, and 2. There will be less great reviews later on! I
think this a combination of OSCON attracting particularly stellar
speakers this year, as well as my own increased skill in finding which
talks I want to go to and can get the most out of. Or maybe I'm just
really happy as I'm writing this because I'm heading home and get to
see my boyfriend in an hour. Who knows. But I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James' talk about how the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine"&gt;JVM&lt;/a&gt; has improved since the mid-2000s was
also excellent. As someone who never writes java and only occasionally
interacts with the JVM via &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.braveclojure.com/"&gt;clojure&lt;/a&gt;, I wasn't sure if I would have
enough context to get much out of this talk. But James explained in
great detail the pain points and horror stories of the old JVM that
many grizzled sysadmins will tell you about. His talk set up the
problem, explained how the JVM has improved and how those improvements
have made impacts in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legacy java is pretty ugly, verbose, and repetitive. And there's &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of bad java out there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JVM has always been generally performant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JVM doesn't always respond to general fixes (for example, you have to tell it to use more memory, not just throw memory at it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JVM needs tuning, not always intuitive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JVM stacktraces are impossible to read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard to automate the JVM (mentioned Puppet!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JVM wasn't transparent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android has really helped modern java improve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JVM is &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; fast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logging has improved dramatically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More transparent now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security has become a much higher priority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Christian Wenz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last talk of the day is a tough slot, but Christian made HTTP headers
both interesting and hilarious. This talk covered the major threats
facing web applications today (namely &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)"&gt;XSS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_hijacking_attack"&gt;Cookie hijacking&lt;/a&gt;,

can actively and easily do to prevent those attacks. Favorite quote was&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;To allow inline javascript, I need to add &lt;code&gt;script-src unsafe-inline;&lt;/code&gt;. Writing 'unsafe-inline' feels so good.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://content-security-policy.com/"&gt;Content Security Policy&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.w3.org/"&gt;W3C&lt;/a&gt; standard for security related http header content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://caniuse.com"&gt;https://caniuse.com&lt;/a&gt; to look up which security policies are supported by which browsers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSP works by having the header and a 'directive', for example &lt;code&gt;default-src 'self';&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Saron Yitbarek&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking questions is scary. It means you have to admit you don't know
the answer, and puts you in a vulnerable position. But asking
questions is key to creating a successful project, and often the
hardest questions are the most important. Saron was well-spoken, and
while this talk wasn't anything revolutionary it was something we
could all be reminded of regularly, and included some excellent
personal stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx/public/schedule/detail/59619"&gt;Half my life spent in open source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Brad Fitzpatrick&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was just a cute telling of Brad's time in open source software,
from learning Perl as a teenager to spending 7 years working on Go.
Included were some wise words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy != quick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything has maintenance cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All code you put online will end up in production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing especially insightful, but a really nice story that I hope a
lot of people in the room could connect to. I love hearing how open
source changes people's lives, and this was an excellent open source
love story well told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Stephanie Hurlburt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VR is cool! This talk wasn't especially insightful, beyond &amp;quot;Lots of VR
development is open source, here are some resources&amp;quot;, but if you're
really stoked about VR it's likely worth watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Liz Baillie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this conference wasn't already chock full of outstanding talks, I
would say this was the best talk of the conference. In addition to
being a programmer Liz is a comic artist, storyteller, and game
developer, all of which came together in an illustrated (and narrated,
&lt;em&gt;with voices&lt;/em&gt;) guide to Rust. I loved that Liz was totally silly
throughout the talk, and although the metaphor sometimes made her
points opaque some aspects of Rust are common knowledge enough that it
would make sense to most people. After describing her adventures in
&amp;quot;Rustlandia&amp;quot;, Liz spoke about her programming experience with Rust,
and compared / contrasted writing a text-based game in Ruby and Rust.
This was a unique, fun, and informative talk delivered with
confidence, poise, and silliness all in good measure. The kind of
speaker I strive to be!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Meaghan Lewis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a classic conference mistake with this talk: I already knew a
lot
about the subject. While I didn't gain any new insights, I was still impressed with the content and structure of the
talk! Meaghan covered common issues one might run in to when testing
using Selenium across multiple browsers, and what might be causing
those issues. She also prescribed some patterns that can help avoid
this issues (like using &lt;code&gt;data-test&lt;/code&gt; selectors in your html), and
talked about some general testing best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Jessica Rose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was like the talk version of a self-help book: mostly generic
advice that's really difficult to implement. Jessica seemed aware of
this, repeating a few times &amp;quot;This is easier said than done&amp;quot;, but that
didn't make her content any more useful or meaningful. Such advice
included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone in your organization should know what open source means to your org, and why it's important for your org&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your open source org should balance transparency with too much information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborative conflict and compromise are what drive the product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And don't get me wrong, all of this is &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; advice. We should all
be transparent, and make compromises that drive our product, and be
open to feedback. We should also probably stop having so much pizza
and wine. By the end of the talk I didn't know any more about how to
have a successful open source company, or even what I could do to
advocate for open source within my company. A good topic, and good if
irrelevant advice, but overall and underwhelming talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="multilayered-testing"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx/public/schedule/detail/56591"&gt;Multilayered testing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Alex Martelli&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, by this point my brain was definitely not running on all
cylinders, so I can't say I got as much out of this talk as I might
have liked. But Alex presented an interesting idea: to have the same
set of tests run for both unit and integration tests, with the main
difference being mocked vs real dependencies (like databases, modules,
etc.). This gave you a unified set of tests, and helps avoid making
some 'white box' assumptions in unit tests. The rest of the talk went
through 'layers' of modules (from low-level modules that many things
depend on, to high-level ones that nothing depends on) and talked
about how to use unit and integration tests at each layer. Being in
QA, I think if I had a few more years of experience under my belt this
talk could have been &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; valuable, and provided ideas for how
to apply these concepts in my job. At this point, though, it just
seems like a neat idea for Later Down the Road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="other-notes"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a speaker, I like to take note of interesting slides or speaking
techniques, and there were a number of great ones at this conference!
Here were a few notable speaking styles I admired:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx/public/schedule/detail/59367"&gt;Step 1: Punch a Tree&lt;/a&gt;, I don't know that I can describe the slides but just watch the video and be in awe. This talk also included music and video, both of which I thought were used &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; well, which is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; difficult. Standing ovation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole Engard of Red Hat wrote a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://opensource.com/article/17/5/making-your-first-open-source-contribution"&gt;nice article&lt;/a&gt; about my talk!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was one of the better OSCONs I've been to, and I came away
inspired and excited about my industry and community. I learned that
the first step is to punch a tree, that TPM stands for more than just
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethered_particle_motion"&gt;tethered particle motion&lt;/a&gt;, and that learning rust is just a
sea of bacon away. Looking forward to next year, when OSCON will be
back in my beautiful hometown &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/portland.html"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

the mind, and her experiences with mental illness.
Semi-autobiographical, the language Plath uses to describe her/Esther's
outlook, experiences, and later treatments is &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt;. Her writing
puts the reader right into Esther's head, and gives them an
understanding of what living with a mental illness is like. Even
better, her language changes throughout the novel as Esther's health
changes, reflecting her darker moods, as well as her better days.
Esther is a fantastically sympathetic and vibrant character, despite
her cynicism and depression. I found myself really invested in her
story and experiences, and again Plath's writing paints a luscious
picture of that story. I don't want to oversell this novel -- I think
part of why I loved it is because I came into it expecting it to be
Yet Another Classic Book which I often find to be overly masculine.
But this wasn't. Throughout the book, even at the peak of Esther's
descent into mental illness, I found myself identifying really
strongly with her and investing in what happened to her. It feels rare
to read a book in a woman's voice that's highly regarded, and I was
very pleasantly surprised by the femininity that colors the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this was another great read. Again, expectations definitely
may have played into my reading, but on the whole I was blown away by
the style, substance, characters, and story of The Bell Jar. Highly,
highly recommended summer reading!&lt;/p&gt;

I have no idea what I
did differently, or which stars were aligned, but I was able to do
more work than I typically do, in less time, and felt energetic and
good while doing it. I was telling Eli about it later, and said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;2017-04-17 11:54:21 lucyw   I&amp;#39;m tentatively thinking about working up
to a half marathon. I think so much of training to run long distance
is really just building up the lung capacity + strength, and it&amp;#39;d be
cool to just see if I can do it. I wasn&amp;#39;t sure if you were interested
in trying to run it (or part of it) with me
2017-04-17 12:14:58 pop I&amp;#39;d be up for a half marathon.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's how I decided to run a half marathon.  It hasn't been a
lifelong goal of mine or anything, or something I thought I would ever
do. It always seemed nearly-but-not-quite-impossible, something I
could probably do if I ever wanted to but which I would never want to
do enough to make it manifest. This would be a fun experiment though.
Could I do it? If not, no big deal -- my expectations would be met, I
would get a good workout in, high-five myself for trying, and move on.
The date was set for Saturday, where we would just give it a try and
see how it went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-day-before"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Day Before&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it's currently Friday April 21, 2017, and the fella and I are
(tentatively) planning on running 13.1 miles tomorrow. We're doing it
on our own, and have both made it clear that we can stop or walk or
give up and go get donuts instead at any time. But I'm curious to see
if I can (we both know he can, skinny jerk). I'm also SUPER NERVOUS.
What if I hurt myself? What if it's hard (it's &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; going to
be hard)? What if I have the wrong shoes and fuck my foot up, or don't
bring enough water, or try to bring too much water and it's too heavy?
I know nerves are normal, and keep reminding myself that this is a
pretty low stakes event that I can bail on at any time. But that
doesn't stop my brain from being like &amp;quot;STRESS STRESS SELF-DOUBT STRESS
NERVES STRESS&amp;quot;. We'll see if I even do it. Though this blog post won't
see the light of day if I &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; do it, so...I guess if you're
reading this, I probably did it. Congratulations, future me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-few-hours-after"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Few Hours After&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler Alert: We did it! We ran 13.1 miles in about 2 hours and 17
minutes (give or take, we weren't super precise). I have a lot of
feelings, some of them conflicting, but let's get to those later and
talk about the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;: Bodies are different. Experiences are different. I'm
writing this to share an interesting experience I had with friends and
family, and not to provide a point of comparison, or suggest that
running a half marathon will in any way be the same for you as it was for
me. I know that disclaimers like this aren't going to cure us of
constantly measuring ourselves against each other, but it's a gentle
reminder and I hope it helps ♥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running a half marathon was surprisingly easy. I don't know how to
explain it, but Eli and I got up this morning it just happened. The
first 5-6 miles were a breeze -- it was a beautiful day, and my body
is pretty used to running this distance. Eli and I also had a lot to
talk about, since we had both had eventful weeks, so these first miles
flew by. Around mile 6.5-7 I felt myself slowing down and tiring out,
so I ate an energy gummy and instantly felt better. Not just a little
bit better, but like Super Woman better. Like, I was &lt;em&gt;fucking running&lt;/em&gt;
better. By mile 8 my legs felt tight and swollen, but definitely not
unbearably so. And in fact, this was the only real &amp;quot;pain&amp;quot; I felt. None
of my joints ached, none of my muscles hurt in that &amp;quot;This is an injury
waiting to happen&amp;quot; way. I wasn't out of breath, I didn't have a
side-ache or shoulder-ache which I typically get on long runs. Even my
lower back didn't hurt. It was strange and wonderful. We started to
count down the miles around mile 9, running down cozy neighborhood
streets to avoid cars and thinking about all the food we were going to
eat when the run was done. I kept expecting my body to hit a wall at
some point in these last 4 miles, but it just never did. By that
point, how could we &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; finish? 3 miles? 2 miles?  When you're
counting down, it seems like &amp;quot;I can run that far, no problem.&amp;quot; We
ended up having to run around the downtown area a bit for our last
mile, but then ended up smack in front of one of our favorite
Corvallis restaurants. And that was it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end it was much less of a Big Deal than I thought it would be.
That isn't to say I think I could have gone on for &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; 13.1
miles, but I hadn't really considered the possibility that it would be
something we just did and then went on with our days. I thought it
would be this big event, like there would be Pre-Half-Marathon life
and Post-Half-Marathon life, but that totally didn't happen. &lt;em&gt;I wasn't
even sore the next day&lt;/em&gt;. It was a weirdly and wonderfully
anti-climatic event. This is where the conflicting feelings come in: I
feel like I should be proud of myself and this thing I accomplished. I
feel like I should be able to relax for the rest of the weekend,
knowing that I have already done so much more than I thought I would
do. But I don't feel like I earned that pride, or relaxation. Not even
as if pride or relaxation need to be earned, but my body didn't want
to rest. I still wanted to go for walks, and write this blog post, and
&lt;em&gt;do stuff&lt;/em&gt;, and not brag to people about how I had run 13.1 miles. It
was a confusing and terrible feeling. My mind was saying &amp;quot;We ran a
half marathon! Break out the ice cream and TV, let's do nothing and
luxuriate in our glory for a few hours&amp;quot;. But my body was like &amp;quot;Nah,
let's make a smoothie and walk to the play ground&amp;quot;. Part of me is so
disappointed by this. If not after a half-marathon, when will I ever
get to rest? When will I be free of the shoulds and have-tos I live in
every day? But another part of me thinks it's cool that my body can
undergo this huge stress, and then considers &amp;quot;taking it easy&amp;quot; to be
continuing to take good care of itself. I don't know where that leaves
me. I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; proud of what I did, and I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; relax when I need to.
So...maybe it's not so bad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="context"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Context&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This part is honestly super boring, especially if you know me. It's
more to hopefully answer any questions people who stumble on this post
might have, rather than add to the story of the post. You can totally
skip it if you want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those not intimately familiar with my entire life's story, here's
some relevant context that affected (effected? Email me if you know
which one is correct) my half marathon.  I used to run long distances
in high school, but could never get past 6-7 miles. And this was at a
time I look back on as being the most fit I've ever been, when I
considered myself &amp;quot;a runner&amp;quot;.  This is all to say that I wasn't
expecting to be able to run a half marathon, having only decided to do
so 5 days before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind, this wasn't couch-to-half-marathon in 5 days. In fact,
just 6 months ago, I walked the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://portlandmarathon.org"&gt;Portland Half-Marathon&lt;/a&gt;, so I knew
that I could at least get my body through 13.1 miles. I workout
religiously 5-6 days each week, doing 30-60 minutes on the
elliptical[1] at least 4 of those days and lifting weights the other
1-2. I love to exercise, and find a lot of joy in moving my body. I
wasn't unfit or unprepared to run a half, and most importantly I know
how to listen to my body and hear when it tells me to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also am not &amp;quot;a runner&amp;quot; though. Eli and I will occasionally run in
Corvallis, since I don't have access to a gym, but as previously
mentioned this wasn't something I had been training for for weeks, or
even something I had particular investment in completing. It was just
an interesting challenge I wanted to see if I was up to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-logistics"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Logistics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.corvallishalfmarathon.com/"&gt;Corvallis Half Marathon&lt;/a&gt; had been put on just a few weeks prior,
and they had posted the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.corvallishalfmarathon.com/uploads/1/0/8/3/10830951/2017_map_for_web.jpg"&gt;course map&lt;/a&gt;. We mostly just followed that,
only starting from Eli's house and ending downtown at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.broken-yolk.com/"&gt;Broken
Yolk&lt;/a&gt; (highly recommend, if you're visiting the area).  We carried a
speaker so we could both listen to podcasts | music, each of us had
our phones (which ended up being helpful), and some energy gummies
that a lovely co-worker had given me (I believe they were the Clif
ones, and they were &lt;em&gt;lifesavers&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="things-to-do-differently-next-time"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Things to Do Differently Next Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not currently planning on running more long distances any time
soon. Then again, I got my first tattoo and thought I wouldn't get
another one for a long time if ever, only to get another much larger
one less than a year later. Here are some thing I would do different
next time though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wish I had researched and bought better running shoes. I ran in
an old pair that I got more for lifting weights than running, and
while they were sufficient for this one run I would definitely not
be able to run regularly in them. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://portlandrunningcompany.com/"&gt;Portland Running Co.&lt;/a&gt; is a
great place to get fitted for running shoes, if you're not loving
your current pair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wish we had mapped the course more accurately. We ended up need
to run our last mile around downtown Corvallis, because the route
we ran ended up being about 12.3 miles instead of 13.1. We still
did it, but it would have been nice to have that final mile not
involve so many cars, pedestrians, and intersections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wish I had a fanny pack. I treated my jacket as a fanny pack, but
it quickly got too hot and I ended up tying it around my waist.
Again, this was fine for the one run, but if I was going to run
more regularly a fanny pack would be super useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running a half marathon was just another thing we did. It wasn't quite
hard, and it definitely wasn't easy, but it's something we may or may
not do again in the future. I don't know how to end blog posts
apparently, so...have an excellent rest of your day! Stay sexy, and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://myfavoritemurder.com"&gt;don't get murdered&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] Judge me if you want, but treadmills are terrifying and they're
better for your joints.&lt;/p&gt;

suit my body's needs my dandruff has stubbornly persisted.  When I was
shampooing every day? Dandruff. When I went months without shampooing?
Dandruff.  Tea tree oil? Dandruff. Special shampoos? Dandruff. I want
to get to the root (ha) of this problem, and &lt;strong&gt;solve my itchy, flaky
scalp without destroying my precious curls&lt;/strong&gt;. Many women, myself
included, will tell you they've spent years perfecting their hair care
routine. It's a science, a long series of experiments and tweaks to
help our hair be healthy and strong.  I don't want to lose all the
progress I've made in that routine, so the challenge here is really to
&lt;strong&gt;fix the dandruff without sacrificing the health of my hair&lt;/strong&gt;.
Challenge: Accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started researching the causes of dandruff and, it turns out, there
are not 1, not 2, but 4 potential causes of dandruff (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dandruff/symptoms-causes/dxc-20215281"&gt;Mayo clinic&lt;/a&gt;).
This means that you'll have to experiment with different treatments to
find what works for you!  Ok, so let's take a look at those causes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="fungus"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fungus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EW! According to the Mayo Clinic, one cause of dandruff is &amp;quot;A
yeast-like fungus, Malassezia, which lives on the scalps of most
adults. But, for some, it irritates the scalp and can cause more skin
cells to grow. The extra skin cells die and fall off, making them
appear white and flaky in your hair or on your clothes. Why malassezia
irritates some scalps isn't known.&amp;quot; Ok, so we all have some fungus on
our heads, and allegedly this is the primary cause of dandruff for
most adults (especially if you're following a solid haircare routine
to begin with). What can we do if it's a problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="treatments"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Treatments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of natural treatments for this type of dandruff,
including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tea tree oil&lt;/strong&gt;. My SO uses &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Now-Foods-Tea-Tree-Oil/dp/B000ELP5KA"&gt;this highly concentrated kind&lt;/a&gt;, rubbing
it into his scalp after a shower about once a month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Cider Vinegar&lt;/strong&gt;. It makes your skin glow! It helps
digestion! It cures cancer! I know, I know, ACV is practically
the coconut oil of 2017. But
allegedly the acidity helps kill the fungus, and prevent it from
growing so quickly. &lt;strong&gt;Lemon juice&lt;/strong&gt; also works for this.  Mix with
equal parts water and spray onto scalp ~15-20 minutes before
showering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medicated Shampoos&lt;/strong&gt;.  You've seen them at the drug store. You're
looking for one that contains ketoconazole, selenium sulfide, or
pyrithione zinc. It's recommended you use it as often as your hair
can handle, which for me is honestly only once a week (even then,
the next day is rough).  If it
helps, awesome! If not, read on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bacteria"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bacteria&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to 2016 study published in Nature, bacteria (mainly
Propionibacterium and Staphylococcus) can contribute more to dandruff
than Malassezia (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep24877"&gt;Study&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="id1"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Treatments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="dry-scalp"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dry Scalp&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms here are small, less-oily white flakes with no redness or
inflammation. It's especially likely that this if your culprit if you're prone to dry skin on
other parts of you as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="id2"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Treatments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="irritated-oily-skin"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Irritated, Oily Skin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AKA seborrheic dermatitis.  According to Mayo Clinic, this is the most
common cause of dandruff, though I'm skeptical of this. The symptoms
include red, irritated, greasy skin covered by flaky white or yellow
scales, and is often found on other hairy parts of the body, not just
your scalp (think: eyebrows).  In other words, you would &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; if you
had this, and would definitely want to do something about it. Hence,
skepticism. But if you take a close look at your scalp in the mirror
and do notice redness or greasiness, this could be what's causing your
dandruff!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="id3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Treatments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is worth seeing your doctor for, and following what they
prescribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="buildup"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Buildup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just when you don't shampoo enough, so dead skin cells and
oils build up then flake off. Honestly, when I
was only shampooing once a month, I didn't notice my dandruff get
better or worse. I'm guessing, if you're reading this, that this isn't
your issue. But it is a common cause of dandruff for the
less-than-tidy among us, and knowledge worth having in your back
pocket for all those times friends ask you for advice on getting rid
of dandruff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="id4"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Treatments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Literally just shampoo more. Any shampoo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bad-reaction-to-products"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bad Reaction to Products&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect this is kind of rare, and once again that you would know if
you had this, but many hair products contain harsh chemicals that your
skin may be reacting to. If you think this might be the case, or
haven't used a new shampoo in a while, I especially like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drbronner.com/"&gt;Dr.Bronner&lt;/a&gt;
products for natural soaps and shampoos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="general-treatments"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;General Treatments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few things you can do to keep your body healthy, and
prevent some dandruff in the process. These are all things you already
know you should be doing, but if dandruff is really the kick in the
pants you need to change some habits then do it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get enough sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink enough water&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a balanced diet&lt;/strong&gt;, including lots of &lt;strong&gt;fruits and vegetables&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-worked-for-me"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Worked for Me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whew! Ok, so a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of things could be causing dandruff. I was pretty
sure that my dandruff wasn't being caused by buildup or a reaction to
any products I was using, and was relatively sure that it wasn't dry
scalp (since my scalp was still oily). The Fungus seemed like the most
likely culprit based on my symptoms and the fact that it's so common,
and since I like using natural products I gave tea tree oil a shot
first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used 100% tea tree oil, and would just dab it on my scalp 1-2 times
each week, and rub it in. This helped a little bit, but not as much as
I had hoped. It was also relatively expensive, especially for how much
oil I had to use for each use. This was definitely a &amp;quot;There must be a
better way!&amp;quot; situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I tried using baking soda as a scalp scrubber. I would use about
2 tbsp of it in the shower, scrubbing my scalp for a minute or two
then rinsing it out. This wasn't a &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; solution, but it was
definitely kind of messy and left my hair feeling a little dry. On the
plus side, though, I discovered that it does make a great (occasional)
face scrub, which I used about once every 2 weeks or when my face is
feeling especially bumpy or oily. So not bad, but not great either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step was to try a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Cosmetics-Dandruff-Shampoo-Rosemary/dp/B000FGDIAS"&gt;natural anti-dandruff shampoo&lt;/a&gt;. I've
always been wary of using shampoo, since curly hair tends to do better
with minimal shampooing and doesn't hold up well to harsh chemicals
and lathering agents common in shampoos (sodium laureth sulfate is
basically my hair's worst nightmare). But I found a shampoo that
didn't have any of the harsh chemicals I had been conditioned to
avoid, was reasonably priced, and had tea tree oil as it's main
anti-dandruff combatant.  Coincidentally at the same time, I decided
to get a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Shampoo-Scalp-Massage-Brush-Century/dp/B0028R4SRO"&gt;scalp scrubber&lt;/a&gt; similar to one my boyfriend uses, which
turned out to be &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; useful. I use the shampoo 2x/week, and use
the scalp scrubber to lather it and make sure that I get it over all
of my scalp. &lt;strong&gt;This was the solution I had been waiting for!&lt;/strong&gt;  My
hair didn't dry out (and, in fact, I got a new conditioner that makes
it super soft and lovely), and my dandruff was &lt;em&gt;gone&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;strong&gt;Gone gone&lt;/strong&gt;.
No more itching, no more flakes everywhere, no more oily finger and
gross keyboard. I cannot overstate what a miracle these 2 products
have been for me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, it was just a matter of trying different things that fit
my lifestyle and needs until I found a solution that works. Regardless
of what's causing your dandruff or if you even have dandruff, I highly
recommend getting a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Shampoo-Scalp-Massage-Brush-Century/dp/B0028R4SRO"&gt;scalp scrubber&lt;/a&gt; (the one linked works for me,
but shop around for one that works for you!). It helps circulate blood
to your scalp, and I've noticed significant improvement in the volume
and health of my hair as well as my scalp since using it (your mileage
may vary). But for $8 you may as well, right? Then, looking into a
natural anti-dandruff shampoo, most likely with tea tree oil, is
another good step if you're looking for things to try. I like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Cosmetics-Dandruff-Shampoo-Rosemary/dp/B000FGDIAS"&gt;this
one&lt;/a&gt;, but again find something that works for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's it folks! I hope this helps you in your own hair and
dandruff journey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

be the best book I read this year. The military has never been a part
of the cultures I grew up in, so my knowledge and awareness of
what the military is, how it's run, and what it does is basically
nothing. I couldn't even tell you all of the branches, or the
distinctions between them. With this context in mind, this book held
incredible insight for me. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rosabrooks.com/"&gt;Rosa Brooks&lt;/a&gt;, a former reporter for the
Pentagon, explains not only what the military does but why it does it,
how it does it, what impacts those actions have. She's able to support
her claims with ample evidence as well as personal stories, and
defends her statements and positions from every possible angle. She
also looks at various parts of the military under a microscope,
explaining the history of this unit or that organization and where
they are today, and also looks very broadly at the military as a whole
complex system and how that system is working. She asks questions like
&amp;quot;What does it mean to be a solider, both historically and today? How
has that role changed in the last 2000 years and in the last decade?&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;Why is our military a proxy for diplomacy, nation building, and
relief effort?&amp;quot;. She explores the relationship between soldiers and
civilians, and how that too has changed dramatically over time.
I came away from the book with a greater
understanding of our military's history, it's present state, and how
it came to be the way that it is. I know more about what the military
does and why it does it, and the pros and cons of having the military
partake in all of the actions that it does.&lt;/p&gt;

was pleasantly surprised to find a modern retelling of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1885.Pride_and_Prejudice"&gt;Pride and
Prejudice&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25852870-eligible"&gt;Eligible&lt;/a&gt; is the delightful and familiar tale of Lizzy
Bennet, her family, and Mrs.Bennet's quest to get &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of her 5
daughters married to a man of means. What I loved about Eligible was
that the author stayed very true to the characters while modernizing
them seamlessly. Jane is sensible and pragmatic, Mrs.Bennet is
exasperated and a little manipulative, Lydia and Kitty are thick as
thieves and a little wild, and Mary is awkward and unaware. Avid P&amp;amp;P
fans (ahem, Mackenzie Broderick) may hold a more critical eye to the
novel, but a pleb like me who has only read P&amp;amp;P twice will no doubt
enjoy the classic tale of women, ambitions, and marriage, told in a
modern setting.&lt;/p&gt;

This post was inspired by a project I was working on
recently, adding a 'lang' option to a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rubygems.org/gems/selenium-webdriver/versions/2.53.4"&gt;Selenium-Webdriver&lt;/a&gt; (the ruby
gem) wrapper. I needed to instantiate
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/selenium-webdriver/0.0.28/Selenium/WebDriver/Driver"&gt;Selenium::Webdriver&lt;/a&gt;.for(:firefox) and (:chrome) both locally and
remotely (Sauce labs, specifically), setting a locale
for each.  There's plenty of documentation on how to do this in
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18645205/set-chromes-language-using-selenium-chromedriver"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sqa.stackexchange.com/questions/9904/how-to-set-browser-locale-with-chromedriver-python"&gt;C&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sqa.stackexchange.com/questions/9904/how-to-set-browser-locale-with-chromedriver-python"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;, but it was hard to find the right
way to do it using the ruby gem. So here's what worked for me, where
&lt;code&gt;&amp;#64;&amp;#64;sweep_options[:lang]&lt;/code&gt; is just a variable that holds either
'en-us' or 'ja' (as strings).&lt;/p&gt;

January is such a melancholy month, isn't it? The
festivities and gatherings have ended, everyone is back to work and
school, and there are weeks of dark, cold days¹ ahead of us. So, to get
my mind off my SO's departure I listened to Jessi Klein's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27170141-you-ll-grow-out-of-it"&gt;You'll Grow
Out of It&lt;/a&gt;. I had seen this book splashed across the Powell's 'New +
Recommended' lists, in the hands and Instagram accounts of
celebrities, and even had it on personal recommendation from a friend.
And it could not have come at a better time. Jessi's book is all about
coming of age, but instead of focusing on adolescence she focuses on
her twenties and thirties. From terrible boyfriends, to better
boyfriends, to a fiancee, and finally to her pregnancy and child
rearing, Klein's book was a laugh and a comfort when I needed it most.
As comfortable as my situation is now, thinking about the future
&lt;em&gt;terrifies&lt;/em&gt; me. How am I going to have kids &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a career? Do I even
want kids? Do I even want a career? Do I want &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; career? What if
things don't work out with my current SO? What if I can't get
pregnant? Or worse, what if I &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; get pregnant? Oh god oh god oh
god oh god oh god oh god. I know I'm not alone, that my millennial
peers are worrying the same worries and fearing the same futures. But
it's still so profoundly comforting to hear the journey of someone you
admire. That the best laid plans often go astray, and that &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;
planning can work itself out. That &lt;strong&gt;you will be OK&lt;/strong&gt; because Jessi
was OK and she doesn't have this any more figured out than you do.
I highly highly highly recommend this book. It will be a friend to
you, no matter where you are or where you see your life going. It will
get you through those dark January days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 The bright side (ha) is that, because I get into the office before
sunrise and leave after sunset, I don't need to wear sunscreen. Score.&lt;/p&gt;

days ago I was buying my last physics textbook, working on my senior
project, and applying to jobs in my spare time. I had never voted in a
Presidential election[1]. I had never ordered a drink at a bar. I had
never left the US. I had never celebrated a 1 year anniversary with an
SO. Though most of us lovingly refer to 2016 as the Year of the
Dumpster Fire, my life got &lt;em&gt;so much better&lt;/em&gt;
over the course of 2016. I &lt;em&gt;graduated&lt;/em&gt;. I can go to 21+ concerts now,
and spend all my money on wine (woops). I got to visit 3 beautiful
countries and experience their culture. And I started working at a
company I love with people who are smarter and kinder than I am, doing
work that not only interests me but lets me to grow and learn
everyday[2]. I don't have any great point to make, or words of wisdom
as we hurtle inevitably into the future. But thinking about the last
year, I can't help but be filled with gratitude. I'm grateful to be
surrounded by family and community who love me, grateful for the
opportunities I've been given, grateful that I am ok and that the
people I love are ok, grateful that I am constantly given chances to
be a better human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be perfectly honest, I'm not excited about 2017. My SO has to go
back to university soon, and leave me sleeping alone again. We have a
long and melancholy winter stretched before us, with short gray days
and long cold nights as far as the eye can see. There are no fun trips
planned, no graduations, no 21st birthdays, no weddings, no reunions.
The thought of the next few months only makes me feel hollow.
But...but there should a but here. But there is no but. It just is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] And had never been devastated by the results of an election
[2] For example, today I learned that some people don't think it's
necessary to pin dependency versions. And that I do not like those
people&lt;/p&gt;

I hope you are enjoying the holiday season,
and are looking forward to some quality time with the people you love
in the coming weeks. Before the madness really started Eli and I got
to spend a week in San Francisco while he visited &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://coreos.com/"&gt;CoreOS&lt;/a&gt;, the tech
startup he interned for this Fall. They were nice enough to get an
AirBnB big enough for the two of us, so I tagged along and took the
week off to explore the city! This post is one part tourists guide to
San Francisco, one part meditations on Silicon Valley, and one part
processing the trip and telling loved ones about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll admit: before this trip the
prospect of working in Silicon Valley felt dire. Anywhere but there!
I thought every engineer would be working 80 hours weeks, a bunch of
20-somethings with nothing better to do than program all day and prove
they were smarter than &lt;em&gt;everyone ever&lt;/em&gt; including me.  I thought of the
Bay as soulless and scrappy, the very definition of rat-race.  And I
wanted no part in it. With some pretty dramatic notions, I came into
this trip like I was interviewing the city to see if I could work
there some day. The beating heart of my industry is there, and to rule
it out completely would be to rule out working for some really great
organizations. I wanted to see if I was justified in categorically
refusing to work in San Francisco, or if I should give it a chance.
I'm happy to report that by the end of the week, San Francisco had won
me over!  Here's how it happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-i-did"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I Did&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Eli spent most of each day working, I had the hours and city to
myself. We were staying in the lower Mission district, so I spent most
of my time walking from there to some of the famous sights and
neighborhoods of San Francisco. There's no better way to get a feel
for a city than just walking through it. I also got to spend the
evenings with Eli's coworkers, talking about CoreOS, school, and
living in the Bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-i-loved"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I Loved&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did on my first day in the city was venture to the
top of the &lt;strong&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/strong&gt;, a hill in the middle of San Francisco that
offers an incredible 360° view of the city. The (walk|climb) was short
but pretty, much of it through parks and sleepy neighborhoods, and the
view from the top was breathtaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, I visited the &lt;strong&gt;San Francisco Botanical Garden&lt;/strong&gt; and
&lt;strong&gt;Japanese Garden&lt;/strong&gt;, in Golden Gate Park.  Honestly, I expected Golden
Gate Park to be this thriving, humming center, similar to Central Park
in New York.  I thought it would be filled with people enjoying
nature, wandering around, sitting on benches and watching life go by.
Instead, it was pretty empty.  But I can tell the city has invested a
lot of money in cleaning it up, and trying to turn it into a Central
Park for San Francisco. The lawns are beautiful, there are tons of
paths and benches and fountains, and there's a lot to see! Even in the
dead of winter, the Botanical Gardens and Japanese Gardens were
beautiful.  Well curated, inviting, and expansive, they were the kind
of places you could get lost in.  It made me miss Forest Park in
Portland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later, I found myself wandering through the &lt;strong&gt;Financial
District&lt;/strong&gt;. Specifically the areas just north and south of Market
street, I found &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt; historic buildings, the kind with lots of
brick and exposed concrete interiors. Filled with fancy shops and
offices and decorated with Christmas lights, these neighborhoods were
absolutely magical, and the reason I fell for the city. I could see
myself walking up and down these streets each weekend, enjoying the
luxury and beauty around me for hours. This was by far my favorite
thing to see, so much so that I went back 2 more times.  Highly,
highly recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearby, I also enjoyed visiting &lt;strong&gt;Union Square&lt;/strong&gt;.  It was totally
packed and crazy, but it was also a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; place to just sit and
people watch. If you're at all into bustling city centers, this is
definitely the place to be!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I enjoyed &lt;strong&gt;the Marina&lt;/strong&gt;, between Ghirardelli Square and the Golden
Gate Bridge. It's a beautiful stretch of beaches and parks, with
beautiful views and nice walkways. If you're visiting either of those
land marks, definitely take the extra half hour to walk along the
beach for a bit. You won't be sorry!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-i-should-have-skipped"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I Should Have Skipped&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fisherman's Wharf&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Pier 39&lt;/strong&gt; were very touristy and
uninteresting, filled with cheap knick-knack shops and nothing unique
or distinctly San Francisco. Unless you're craving some In n' Out,
you're better off spending you're time elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haight-Ashbury&lt;/strong&gt; was boring at best, unsafe at worst. I thought it
would be like the beloved Hawthorne street in Portland, full of
cute and eclectic local shops, but ended up treading on used needles
as I walked past smoke shop after smoke shop. When I saw one of the
many idle young men along the street pull out a large knife to show to
his friend, I veered onto a side street and decided there were better
things to see in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my last day exploring the city I finally made it up to the &lt;strong&gt;Golden
Gate Bridge&lt;/strong&gt;. The American icon! The Gate to the West! Don't get me
wrong, the bridge is beautiful.  I highly recommend &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt; it.  My
mistake was walking across it.  It's incredibly loud and windy (like,
might blow you over windy), with huge trucks and buses rushing by just
inches away. The bridge is far above the water, and the railing that stands between you
and certain death is not nearly high enough to actually make you feel
safe.  There are lots of people and &lt;em&gt;kids&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;bicyclists&lt;/em&gt; going all
directions that only add to the chaos and disorientation. Really, it
feels like Australia: everything is trying to kill you, one way or
another. It's also &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; -- it took me ~40 minutes to get all the way
across, including 2 long stops at the pillars to take some deep
breaths and text Eli my last will and testament. So drive across. Or
just don't cross it at all. There's nothing on the other side, &lt;em&gt;trust
me&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, San Francisco proved itself to have more character and
coziness than we expected. I loved exploring the city, and
unexpectedly found that I could see myself living there for a few
years, working a fancy schmancy tech job in the city. We aren't making
any plans yet, and who knows what the future holds for us, but it
turns out it might actually be San Francisco.  Who's to say?  I'm
never certain of how to end these posts, but thanks for reading, and
have a lovely day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

detailing different parts of his life until now. Although the book is
done in the style of the Choose Your Own Adventure books, I listened
to the book on tape where flipping to page 129 wasn't exactly feasible
:p . The author himself narrates it though, and did his best to take
us through the book from start to finish without getting lost along
the way. NPH's past, from aspiring adolescent actor to young stardom
to proud husband and parent, is an interesting story told with classic
NPH humor. I can't say it was my favorite autobiography, as it
definitely erred on the side of trying too hard to be funny rather
than genuine or meaningful. But, walking the streets of San Francisco,
this book definitely held my interested and brightened my days. It was
entertaining, but didn't leave me feeling like I had insight into who
NPH was as a person at all. I will say, though, that listening to him
talk (or read aloud) about his kids was &lt;em&gt;heart melting&lt;/em&gt;.  I had no
idea what the experiences of being a &amp;quot;closeted&amp;quot; gay celebrity or a gay couple trying to
have kids were, and hearing about those first-hand was super
interesting. Definitely a tiny drop of knowledge from a world I know
little or nothing about, which is always excellent!  Overall, I
definitely recommend this book if you're looking for something light,
that doesn't require too much attention, or love all things NPH.&lt;/p&gt;

Be Different&lt;/a&gt; by Maria Semple. And unfortunately, it won't be finding
it's way to my 'New + Recommended' list any time soon. The book
follows Eleanor through a particularly whirl-wind day, from her son
Timby feigning illness to her husband becoming an unexpected
Christian. It was charming and short, definitely a decent mindless
read to have on as background noise. Though the main character,
Eleanor, was entertaining I didn't find that I connected with her very
much, or particularly cared what happened to her. That's more on me
than the novel -- she's a nuanced and well-formed character, a mildly
neurotic housewife doing her best amid the mess that is Life, who I
think a lot of people &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; resonate with.  I just didn't. But beyond
that, the book was honestly boring. Boring books aren't always bad,
they can keep you company and fill the space between more grandiose
cousins. But at the end of the day there's nothing memorable, lasting,
or insightful about the book. If you're looking for something to pick
up this isn't the first thing I'd recommend, but it's not the worst
choice either.  It's the 'meh' choice.&lt;/p&gt;

abusive relationships aren't usually as black-and-white as we like to
think. 'It Ends With Us' follows Lily Bloom as she opens her own
flower shop and falls in love with a surgeon, Ryle Kincaid. With a
history of abuse in the family and vivid memories of her mother
covered in bruises and cuts, Lily knows too well the cycle of violence
and apology that so many abusive men exhibit. But when her
relationship with Ryle takes increasingly dark turns, she denies that
anything is wrong. At first they seem like such small incidents --
things that could happen to anybody. We all lose our tempers, or lash
out when we don't mean to. But as Ryle becomes her husband, and then
the father of her child, his violence escalates. With her own daughter
on the way, she's faced with a choice: be just like her mother, or
leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'It Ends With Us' was deeply personal for Colleen Hoover, and that shines
through in the novel. The characters are rich and sympathetic, and
they show the nuance and shades of grey in an abusive relationship.
It's easy to look in from the outside and judge victims of abuse for
staying. How can they not see what's happening to them? How can they
live each day with people who hit them, or scream at them? 'It Ends
With Us' helped me understand how those relationships are like frogs
in hot water, how abusive husbands can have a lot of good qualities
and think they are good people (though make no mistake, they are
&lt;em&gt;monsters&lt;/em&gt;), and how it can be easy to explain away incidents of
abuse. I won't spoil anything, but I will say that there's also a very
happy ending, which was well worth sticking around for!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was deeply touched by 'It Ends With Us', and came away not only with
another good love story in my ears but with a deeper understanding of
what victims of abuse go through. The mark of a great book is one that
not only entertains and rivets, but that changes the way you move
through everyday life and see the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've spent far, far too much of my life thinking about my body.  Is it
thin enough, pretty enough, good enough? As if that's any reflection
of me as a person. But for all of that obsession I rarely took time
to appreciate all of the things my body is capable of, and how
&lt;em&gt;valuable&lt;/em&gt; my health is. It requires a lot of maintenance (was 8
hours of sleep really necessary, evolution?), but having a healthy
body lets me focus on living and experiencing and enjoying.  I can
spend hours hiking, eat most foods, and take care of myself entirely
on my own. I don't need to take a pill in the morning, or worry about
whether a restaurant will have something that's safe for me to eat.
And I'm able-bodied, a privilege I take entirely for granted which
influences how others see and treat me. My body
is the vessel I live in, my home, my rock, and it's been a damn good
one at that. For that, I'm grateful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this isn't usually the first (or third) thing folks think of
when considering things they're grateful for, but there are many
aspects of my work that fill me with appreciation and joy. I have the
privilege of doing work that I love, that is challenging, interesting,
and fulfilling, where I get to spend my days learning, creating, and
solving complex problems. What's more I get to do all of this with
people who are smarter and kinder than I am, constantly inspiring me
to grow and be a better human. I work with people I look forward to
seeing, who &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/respect.html"&gt;respect and care for me&lt;/a&gt;, who &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; me and who I can be
myself around. I definitely never expected my workplace to be the
first place I went after a national tragedy, and expected even less to
be consoled and comforted by my coworkers. Leaving work that day was
the moment I knew I was in the right place. The cherry on top is that
I work at a company that values my contributions, that makes me feel
welcome, and that works hard to make sure I'm appropriately
compensated for my work.  And my commute is a 30 minute walk! There's
no where else I'd rather spend most of my waking hours, that's for
sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You guys. You. Guys. I can't believe how lucky I am to have such good
friends. These aren't friends that I take selfies with and tag
&amp;quot;Besties!&amp;quot;, these are people who have seen me ugly cry, who were
&lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt; for me when times got tough, who stuck it out with me even
when I wasn't the nicest person or greatest friend. They let me sit
with them at lunch when no one else would. They intervened when I was
dating someone who wasn't nice to me. They shared their crayons with
me, went to summer camps with me, spent countless christmases and
thanksgivings and easters with me, and have &lt;em&gt;loved me unconditionally&lt;/em&gt;
for decades now. I'm so grateful to have&lt;/p&gt;

the things I'm grateful for. Now, more than ever, I think we all need
to take some time to appreciate what is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; in the world and remind
friends and family that &lt;em&gt;they are loved&lt;/em&gt;. Remind ourselves that &lt;em&gt;we
are loved&lt;/em&gt;. That our lives are so full, and that we have so much to
give to others. In an effort to spiritually recharge and fully
appreciate how &lt;em&gt;lucky&lt;/em&gt; I am, I plan to write a post each day leading
up to Thanksgiving on something I'm grateful for. This exercise is
definitely something I need in my life right now, to focus on my
values and what's important to me.  As a fair warning I know posts
about how great my life is can come off as boastful, or
holier-than-thou, and I want to emphasize that's not what I intend. Acknowledging what a privileged life I lead is meant to make me
aware of the complex factors that give me that privilege, and help me
work to afford that privilege to &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;. Knowing that &lt;em&gt;I did not
get here on my own&lt;/em&gt; helps me internalize that society is not an equal
playing field, and that &amp;quot;success&amp;quot; is less a measure of character than
of advantage. Alright, enough preaching, let's get to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's topic is the obvious choice: &lt;strong&gt;Family&lt;/strong&gt;. Beyond literally
giving me life, my parents have supported me in every endeavor I've
undertaken, and provided me endless opportunities to learn, grow, and
achieve my goals. They provided for me, so I never had to go to school
hungry or wonder where I would sleep at night. They are loving, so I
never doubt for a second that they are proud of me, or love me, or
will be there for me &lt;em&gt;no matter what&lt;/em&gt;. They are kind, thoughtful, good
people, who have dedicated their lives to making their little corner
of the world a better place. I'm grateful to have a brother I could
share my childhood with, who initially challenged me to not hit back
and now challenges me to think critically and objectively.  It's so
much easier to move through the world knowing that if anything
happened I have people I can ask for help, for advice, for
understanding, for forgiveness, and they would give it
unconditionally. For that, I'm grateful.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm angry. I'm afraid of how the
next four years could impact my life and lives of those I love.  And
after Tuesday night, I was left wondering &lt;em&gt;what can I do?&lt;/em&gt;  It's easy
to feel powerless, and hopeless.  To join a facebook group or go to a
protest, because that feels like the only thing there is to do to
express your grief, your rage, your heart sickness. But there are more
concrete steps you can take to fight for what is good in this world.
And &lt;strong&gt;there is still good&lt;/strong&gt;. There are many organizations and
individuals fighting for what we believe in, and more than anything
what we can do now is &lt;strong&gt;stand together with them&lt;/strong&gt;.  That's how we can
create the changes we want to see in our nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who are these organizations? What are they doing? How can you support
them?  Here are some short lists of fantastic groups of people, and
how they need your help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="volunteer"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Volunteer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to support an organization is by giving your
time and energy towards their cause.  &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.volunteermatch.org/search/orgs.jsp"&gt;Volunteermatch.com&lt;/a&gt; is a great
resource for finding opportunities near you that align with causes you
are most passionate about. This list is specific to Portland, OR,
though these organizations have many chapters across the US and
similar groups in many cities. You can also &lt;strong&gt;donate&lt;/strong&gt; to many of
these organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.basicrights.org/get-involved/volunteer/"&gt;Basic Rights Oregon&lt;/a&gt; works to protect the rights of marginalized
groups across Oregon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.projectaccessnow.org/"&gt;Project Access Now&lt;/a&gt; has volunteer positions for people of all
skills, from community members to healthcare providers, that allow
you to help underprivileged people get the healthcare they need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.forestparkconservancy.org/"&gt;Park Conservancy&lt;/a&gt; to preserve and maintain parks in your city&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://friendsoftrees.org/"&gt;Friends of Trees&lt;/a&gt; plants trees!  No experience necessary to
volunteer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="donate"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Donate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the means, there are a number of organizations fighting
the good fight who need funds for equipment, legal fees, travel,
paying organizers, and various other necessities to keep their doors
open and continue to change the world for the better. Here are some
awesome organizations that especially need your support now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/"&gt;Planned Parenthood&lt;/a&gt; provides reproductive healthcare to women
across the US that is affordable and safe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://action.aclu.org/secure/protect-rights-freedoms-we-believe-6?s_src=UNV160001HERO&amp;amp;ms=web_hero"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)&lt;/a&gt; aims &amp;quot;To maintain
and advance civil liberties, including, without limitation, the
freedoms of association, press, religion, and speech, and the rights
to the franchise, to due process of law, and to equal protection of
the laws for all people throughout the United States and its
jurisdictions.&amp;quot; And they're gearing up to see Donald Trump in court.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.naacp.org/"&gt;NAACP&lt;/a&gt;. Their website says it best: &amp;quot;The mission of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)
is to ensure the political, educational, social, and economic
equality of rights of all persons and to eliminate race-based
discrimination.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.childrenshealthfund.org/"&gt;Children's Health Fund&lt;/a&gt; provides healthcare to the nations
most underserved children, reducing the impact of the healthcare
crises on those most vulnerable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thetrevorproject.org/"&gt;Trevor Project&lt;/a&gt; has a very simple mission: end suicide among
LGBTQ+ people, especially young folks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://csgv.org/"&gt;Coalition to Stop Gun Violence&lt;/a&gt; is comprised of 47 national
organizations working to advance gun control and end gun violence in
America&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: I'm having trouble finding reliable pro-immigration
organizations or advocacy groups. If you know of any that you support
please email me at &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:wyman.lucy&amp;#64;gmail.com"&gt;wyman.lucy&amp;#64;gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="empower"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Empower&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the people we are capable of impacting most are those
closest to us. I know &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of you reading this already support your
sons, daughters, siblings, parents, friends, students, and coworkers. You
encourage them to do what they love, to create the world they want to
live in, to reach for their dreams, and be kind to others. The ripple
effects of that empowerment are what create the society we live in,
and that is by far the most &lt;strong&gt;impactful&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;positive&lt;/strong&gt; thing you can
do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also read more about &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://codeascraft.com/2016/10/19/being-an-effective-ally-to-women-and-non-binary-people/"&gt;being an effective ally&lt;/a&gt; to
marginalized groups (the article is specific to women and non-binary
folks, but I find the principles apply to most groups).  That article
has been a guiding light to me in the past months, and has helped me
be aware of my actions and how I can help others with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know you've seen all the same positive quotes and inspirational text
I have.  I won't echo much of that here, but will say you are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;
powerless.  Even if your action is as simple as talking to your loved
ones about what has happened, and what you can do for them in their
times of need, you are fighting the prejudice and hatred reflected in
our laws and policies. I'll leave you with the quote that brought us
all to tears: &amp;quot;Please never stop believing that fighting for
what’s right is worth it. It is, it is worth it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you for reading! If you have any questions or comments, please

It's too early.  But...is it? I feel like I go through
this every year: it's always too early to start thinking about the
holidays until December 20th, and then I'm scrambling to find or make
good gifts for my family and friends. I don't know about you, but I do
&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; work best under that kind of pressure. I also don't have the
foresight to do what my mom does and just shop for presents
year-round, finding things she thinks people will like. We can't all
be planners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, November 4th seems like a good enough in between. And what better
gift is there to give than a good story?  Whether your
recipient is an enthusiastic reader or hasn't picked up a book in
years, I think there's something for everyone at the local book store.
Here are my recommendations, no matter who you're giving to!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="for-the-non-reader"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For the Non-Reader&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is definitely the hardest person to buy a book for. But with
the rise of audiobooks, coloring books, and graphic novels
I think you can find something for everyone! Let's break it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="audiobooks"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Audiobooks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't overstate how much I love audiobooks. I spend so much time
walking, running, doing laundry, cooking, stretching, &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt;, and
being able to spend that time with a book in my ears has been
life changing. I use &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://app.overdrive.com/"&gt;Overdrive&lt;/a&gt; (way better than Audible!), which
connects to your local library and lets you download e-books and
audiobooks to any device, including &lt;em&gt;your phone&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;For free&lt;/strong&gt;.
Fancy, right? Here's how you can turn that into a non-reader gift:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set it up&lt;/strong&gt;. Installing the app, connecting it to the library,
downloading books, connecting the phone to the
car...it can be a lot. Getting everything ready to go so your loved
one just has to press 'play' could be the push they need to remember
how much they love books!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CDs&lt;/strong&gt;. I know I know I know. But again, sometimes setting it all
up on the phone is just too much.  Give your loved one a book on
tape they can play in the car. Especially perfect if you've got an
upcoming road trip!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your own recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;. Sharing a book together is a beautiful
thing. Seeing a novel through someone else's eyes can open up new
perspectives, interpretations, and meaning you may not have seen.
And you get to share a thing you love with a person you love.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="coloring-books"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Coloring Books&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've seen them.  You've thought &amp;quot;Really? Adult coloring books?&amp;quot;.
Your friend's mom has one. And now, your mom can have one too!
Coloring is meditative, methodic, excellent to keep your hands busy
while watching TV.  Here are a few that look neat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.powells.com/book/secret-garden-an-inky-treasure-hunt-coloring-book-9781780671062/1-20"&gt;The Secret Garden&lt;/a&gt;. Kind of the OG coloring book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.powells.com/book/color-me-calm-100-coloring-templates-for-meditation-relaxation-9781937994778/1-0"&gt;Color Me Calm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.powells.com/book/pride-prejudice-a-coloring-classic-9781524701123/1-1"&gt;Pride and Prejudice: A Coloring Classic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find more of them &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.powells.com/books/childrens/activities/coloring-books"&gt;at Powell's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="graphic-novels"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Graphic Novels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just for kids! Graphic novels have grown into beautifully
illustrated, intricate stories with as much character development,
plot, and meaning as any other book.  Here are a few that are really
stunning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25179.Blankets"&gt;Blankets&lt;/a&gt; by Craig Thompson. This was definitely the first graphic
novel I read where I realized what a graphic novel could be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22040598-the-sculptor"&gt;The Sculptor&lt;/a&gt; by Scott McCloud. Per the recommendation of my SO, a
graphic novel fan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="for-the-history-buff"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For the History Buff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27209433-white-trash"&gt;White Trash: The 400-Year Untold History of Class in America&lt;/a&gt; by
Nancy Isenberg. America is hardly classless,
anybody-can-be-anything country  we like to think it is. This book
recounts the history of the mistreatment of the poor, and discusses
the surprising origins of elitism in the US (hint: owning land used
to be a BFD).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077874-hrc"&gt;HRC&lt;/a&gt; by Amie Parnes and Jonathan Allen. You may as well start
reading up on the life and times of our future president ;) It
focuses on her time as Secretary of State, but I think it has great
insight into how she makes decisions, what motivates her, and is
relatively objective and accurate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="for-the-girl-boss"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For the Girl Boss&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far the hardest category to narrow down, it's hard to go wrong with
any of these titles for the feminist reader (woops, sorry, I

intimate look into who Amy Schumer is, and how she came to be the
person she is today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12262741-wild"&gt;Wild&lt;/a&gt; by Cheryl Strayed. I know this book was trendier last year,
but if your loved one didn't get a chance to read it it's well worth
coming back to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17851885-i-am-malala"&gt;I am Malala&lt;/a&gt; by Malala Yousafzai. If you're not sure who she is,

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24113.G_del_Escher_Bach"&gt;Gödel, Escher, Bach&lt;/a&gt; by Douglas Hofstadter is a mind-bending, brain-exploding math +
philosophy book. This is perfect your friend who just started grad
school.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17290683-love-and-math"&gt;Love and Math&lt;/a&gt; by Edward Frenkel is just a great math book.  Part memoir, part
linear algebra, Edward Frenkel discusses how he came to love math,
what he endured to be part of the mathematics community, and what he
spent his life researching and discovering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693884-how-not-to-be-wrong"&gt;How Not to Be Wrong&lt;/a&gt; by Jordan Ellenberg is for the armchair mathematician. It's a
critical analysis of how we approach problems, and common data
analytics methods.  More &amp;quot;How to think about this real-world issue&amp;quot; than
&amp;quot;Here's how Andrew Wiles solved the Fermat Theorem&amp;quot;.  My favorite
quote is:
&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;And you can't deny that there are aspects of the natural
world - I'm thinking pandas here - that seem more likely to have
resulted from grudging bureaucratic compromise than from the mind of
an all knowing deity with total creative control&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="for-the-csi-fan"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For the CSI Fan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've unexpectedly started reading mysteries recently. I
didn't even know what I was getting myself into, but here are a few
juicy ones I've enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27274343-i-m-thinking-of-ending-things"&gt;I'm Thinking of Ending Things&lt;/a&gt; by Iain Reid. A short but
satisfying thriller.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26114146-all-is-not-forgotten"&gt;All is Not Forgotten&lt;/a&gt; by Wendy Walker. As a mystery noob, I'm &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt;
invested in this book. Is it the son?  The pot dealer? I was hooked,
and so satisfied by the ending.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22557272-the-girl-on-the-train"&gt;The Girl on the Train&lt;/a&gt; by Paula Hawkins. Honestly, when I first read it I
thought it was a little meh. I had a hard time connecting to the
main character, or caring about what happened to her. But with all
the hype + the movie, I may have to give it another read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="for-the-friend-with-a-bb8-pillow"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For the Friend with a BB8 Pillow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AKA Sci-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9969571-ready-player-one"&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/a&gt; by Ernest Cline is a totally accessible and fun
story. It's a classic hero's tale, with 80's geek and gamer culture
mixed in. Highly recommend for readers of any age.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12007.Use_of_Weapons"&gt;Use of Weapons&lt;/a&gt; by Iain Banks is by far my favorite sci-fi book.
Great characters, an excellent ending, compelling plot, and very
interesting premise. Highly, highly recommend for all readers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59924.The_Lathe_of_Heaven"&gt;The Lathe of Heaven&lt;/a&gt; by Ursula K. LeGuin is a solid, satisfying
sci-fi adventure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="for-the-people-person"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For the People Person&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section is really just an excuse to recommend &lt;a class="reference internal" href="#when-breath-becomes-air"&gt;When Breath
Becomes Air&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="#when-breath-becomes-air"&gt;When Breath Becomes Air&lt;/a&gt; by Paul Kalanathi is the heartbreaking
story of a young neurosurgeon diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer.
Intimate with the American healthcare system as both a doctor and a
patient, this book has fascinating insights and thoughts around the
ultimate question: &lt;em&gt;What makes life worth living?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="#the-audacity-of-hope"&gt;The Audacity of Hope&lt;/a&gt; by Barack Obama, for when you need to
revitalize your faith in our country's politicians.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="the-audacity-of-hope"&gt;&lt;span id="when-breath-becomes-air"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;And that's all she wrote, folks! I hope you have a wonderful holiday
season, surrounded by family and friends you love ♥&lt;/p&gt;

necessarily reflect the experiences of others, including other women
at my company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's no secret that there's an &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#developer-profile-gender"&gt;incredible shortage&lt;/a&gt; of women in the
tech industry, and even less of a secret that &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/boy.html"&gt;women are treated
differently than men&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in tech. This discrimination manifests itself in a lot of
ways, but for the most part it comes down to a single fact: &lt;strong&gt;we think
it's ok to disrespect women&lt;/strong&gt;.  Often times this is completely
subconscious, which doesn't absolve us of responsibility but does
point out how deeply ingrained in us sexism is. I, too, am guilty of
assuming my friend's pronoun-less colleague is a &amp;quot;he&amp;quot;, and assuming
Bob knows what he's talking about but Alice doesn't¹.  So when I
recently took a job at my company, I unconsciously expected some of
this bias to color my daily interactions. I didn't even think about
it; of course it was something I would have to deal with. I was a lady
programmer at the bottom of the corporate totem pole. Why should men
with 20+ years of experience in the field listen to me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against all of my unconscious and grim expectations my co-workers at
my company treat me as a qualified peer.  They ask for my input and
thoughts on important decisions. They pause and &lt;em&gt;listen&lt;/em&gt; when I speak,
considering what I say with as much weight as they would anyone else
on the team. They don't laugh when I ask a question or shame me for
not knowing a fact, instead pointing out that it's &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; that I'm
asking questions and should continue to do so if I don't know
something.  They explain things with patience and clarity and not an
ounce of condescension, and have taken entire man-days to help get me
up to speed on specific projects and technologies.  Working for
my company, and specifically with this team, has given me a greater
understanding of how to be respectful as well as be respected.  I
realized all of the little things that my peers at university said and
did -- that &lt;em&gt;I also&lt;/em&gt; said and did -- that indicated a lack of respect
and awareness, and am slowly learning to not do those things. It's
entirely a work in progress, and I still say or do things that I'm not
proud of.  But I'm much more aware of when I slip up, why, and am able
to apologize and move on more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's most amazing is that all of this is done without any fanfare.
It was taken for granted that I was an intelligent, worthy team member
who has as much to contribute as anyone else on the team. My ideas
were always measured equally, and without the obvious effort or
uneasiness of those learning to respect women. My company has created a
place where I feel welcome, comfortable, and safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why am I telling you this?  Because 6 months ago I thought I would
always have to live with an undercurrent of misogyny.  I thought I
would always be shamed for not knowing some fact, or not getting the
video game reference. And I want you to know that &lt;em&gt;you can expect
more&lt;/em&gt;. I read so many heartbreaking articles and stories about what
women go through at work, and know first hand how &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; it is to be a
minority in the tech industry. And I want to emphasize that my
experience does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; diminish or invalidate the experiences of
others. The way women are treated in my industry is not OK. But I want
you to know that &lt;em&gt;it isn't always like that&lt;/em&gt;, that it &lt;em&gt;doesn't have to
be that way&lt;/em&gt;. My company isn't perfect.  Heck, of our 130 engineers
only ~10% identify as female.  &lt;strong&gt;10%&lt;/strong&gt;.  They just increased maternity
leave from &lt;strong&gt;two weeks&lt;/strong&gt; to six weeks.  But I am valued and
appreciated, implicitly and explicitly. And for that, I am incredibly
privileged and thankful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you for reading!  If you are interested in learning more about
being an ally to minorities, I highly recommend the article&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://codeascraft.com/2016/10/19/being-an-effective-ally-to-women-and-non-binary-people/"&gt;Being an
Effective Ally&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;em&gt;It has been a guiding light to me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] Being aware of that bias has helped me stop doing those things,
but it takes time and concious effort to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

was a surprising delight to read. Like most books I checked it out
only knowing that Powell's had it on their 'New + Recommended' list,
and was pleased when I found myself in the middle of a psychological
thriller, begging the protagonist not to go into the basement. The
novel starts out innocuously, and it wasn't until maybe 2/3 of the way
through that I realized it wasn't going the direction I expected &lt;em&gt;at
all&lt;/em&gt;.  I don't want to give too much away, but this a quick and
satisfying read if you're up for a little horror and a little thrill.
The ending is entirely unexpected, and raises a lot of interesting
points about our identity, perceptions, reality, and the pliability of
the human mind.  I would highly highly recommend it!&lt;/p&gt;

and couldn't find the answer on the internet.  I'm writing tests for
Puppet's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.puppet.com/pe/latest/app_orchestration_overview.html"&gt;application orchestrator&lt;/a&gt; which involve setting up an
application remotely then running some variations of &lt;code&gt;puppet job
run&lt;/code&gt;.  In particular, I need to specify an environment (&lt;code&gt;-e or
--environment&lt;/code&gt;) and an application instance (&lt;code&gt;-a or
--application&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's my directory structure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
[root&amp;#64;hostname environments]# tree
.
├── production
│&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ├── environment.conf
│&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ├── hieradata
│&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ├── manifests
│&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; │&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; └── site.pp

        │&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; │&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ├── init.pp
        │&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; │&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; └── web_component.pp

                    └── type
                        ├── testhttp.rb
                        └── testsql.rb
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the output of running &lt;code&gt;puppet app show -e tmpenv&lt;/code&gt; is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
App_one[Health Check Test]
    App_one::Db_component[Health Check Test] =&amp;gt; y21898u9zb3yin5.delivery.puppetlabs.net
        + produces Testsql[Health Check Test]
    App_one::Web_component[Health Check Test] =&amp;gt; hzmjunpoua0mxeo.delivery.puppetlabs.net
        consumes Testsql[Health Check Test]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so, as I see it there are 2 strong candidates for what the
&amp;quot;&amp;lt;APPLICATION&amp;gt;&amp;quot; referred to in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.puppet.com/pe/latest/orchestrator_job_run.html"&gt;puppet orchestrator
documentation&lt;/a&gt; could be: &lt;strong&gt;app_one&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;App_one[Health Check
Test]&lt;/strong&gt;. Here's the output for each of those (using puppet job plan so
that I'm not creating new job id's and logs all over the place):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
[root&amp;#64;hostname environments]# puppet job plan -e tmpenv -a app_one
Failed to submit plan: puppetlabs.orchestrator/unknown-target: The target was not found in environment tmpenv: app_one

terminate called after throwing an instance of 'HorseWhisperer::action_validation_error' what():  Validation Error: You supplied too many arguments to the run command. Only 1 is allowed.
  Aborted
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In desperation, I decide to try a combination of the two &lt;strong&gt;App_one&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
[root&amp;#64;hostname environments]# puppet job plan -e tmpenv -a
App_one
+-------------------+---------+
| Environment       | tmpenv  |
| Target            | App_one |
| Concurrency Limit | None    |

+-------------------+---------+

Application instances: 1
  - App_one[Health Check Test]

Node run order (nodes in level 0 run before their dependent nodes in
level 1, etc.):

1 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
hzmjunpoua0mxeo.delivery.puppetlabs.net
    App_one[Health Check Test] - App_one::Web_component[Health
    Check Test]

Use `puppet job run --application 'App_one' --environment
tmpenv` to create and run a job like this.
Node catalogs may have changed since this plan was
generated.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success!  I later discovered that &lt;code&gt;puppet job plan -e tmpenv -a
&amp;quot;App_one[Health Check Test]&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; also worked.  It's still unclear to me
why the name needs be capitalized, but I trust that there are good and
well thought out Reasons which just aren't documented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you don't know, now you know :)&lt;/p&gt;

season, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26893819-the-girls"&gt;The Girls&lt;/a&gt; by Emma Cline.  I was very intrigued by this book
since it had been hyped so much, and after reading it am somewhat
mystified by the noise around it.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't a
&lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; book.  But if I had the ear of millions of people, it's
definitely not the first one I would recommend either. I'll start with
what I liked, compliment sandwich style.  Emma Cline's use of language
is incredible, and her ability to set a scene and make you &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt;
every detail of that scene is unparalleled.  Those tiny things you
notice but would never think to write down, or describe in the way she
does, and then the way she builds entire characters and events out of
those details is amazing. You can feel sticky heat, the stings of
shame, the meaning imbued in a moment's hesitation or a sideways
glance.  All of those microscopic tinges are blown up to full size,
and make the book &lt;em&gt;rich&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so, I loved Cline's writing, why was the book just meh? The
content was really the downfall of this book.  I didn't find any of
the characters compelling, and found it &lt;em&gt;painfully&lt;/em&gt; slow at many
points. There's a murder set up in the opening paragraphs which
becomes the climax of the story, but the journey to that climax takes
&lt;em&gt;so long&lt;/em&gt; and involves little to no detail about the murder.  Someone
dies, and we don't even know or care about that person. The murder is
supposed to be the climax, but at the end falls utterly flat.  I will
give Cline credit for her time-jumping between modern day and memory.
She used it well to develop the main character and made it obvious which
era you were currently reading, both of which are hard to do well and
hard to do well at the same time. But in the end that definitely
couldn't save a half-hearted story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're thinking about picking it up, and leave it at the bottom of
your to-read list. It's definitely worth giving a try, but I wouldn't
hurry to read it.&lt;/p&gt;

read &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.garthstein.com/works/the-art-of-racing-in-the-rain/"&gt;The Art of Racing in the Rain&lt;/a&gt; by Garth Stein. As a dog owner
and lover I was simultaneously excited and wary of another book about
a dog where the dog inevitably the dog dies at the end. But I set
aside my trepidation and dove in, and was rewarded tremendously for
doing so! The book is narrated by a dog, Enzo, as he chronicles the
life of his beloved owner Denny. But it is about &lt;em&gt;so much more&lt;/em&gt; than
the relationship between a man and his dog.  It's about the pain of
cancer and death, the different ways we grieve, and ultimately focuses
on how bad things happen to good people. It's about making the hardest
right decisions, about being the bigger person, all told through the
lens of racing (yes, car racing) by the canine narrator.  And it made
me &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; so strongly.  I had such visceral reactions to the events of
the book, and realized that was part of what made it so good.  The
characters were so compelling, the events so relatable, I found my
blood boiling at points, experienced jubilation and depression and
grief right alongside the characters.  So much malice! So much hope!
The role of the dog as narrator doesn't even really stand out in
hindsight, as it's completely eclipsed by the richness of the rest of
the novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if you couldn't tell, I loved the book and would highly
recommend it. I'll admit it starts out a little slow, but try to power
through at least 1/3 of it before giving up entirely (it's a short

Puppet class, googled this exact title, and came up totally empty
handed. After wading through dozens of StackOverflow posts and puppet
docs, I still wasn't sure what I needed to accomplish this or how it
would fit into our Beaker tests. I admittedly don't have much
experience with Puppet, and ended up spending a few hours with a
coworker learning about the most efficient way to achieve this.  This
is essentially the post I wish I had found a week ago (or will wish
existed 6 months from now when I need to do the same thing and have
forgotten all of this).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING&lt;/strong&gt;: This post is for n00bs, not l33t
puppet haxxors.  You've been warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OTHER WARNING&lt;/strong&gt;: This post assumes that you already have a
remote puppet master, and are most likely using Beaker or some other
testing harness to interact with that master. You'll also need to make
sure $test_harness has root privileges on the master, as you'll be
writing to &lt;code&gt;/etc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-endgame"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Endgame&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, I wanted to ensure that a UTF-8 encoded class (with non
&lt;code&gt;\A[a-z][a-z0-9_]*\Z&lt;/code&gt; characters) would not be displayed in the
Puppet Enterprise GUI (per &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/reference/lang_reserved.html#acceptable-characters-in-names"&gt;Puppet's acceptable character specs&lt;/a&gt;).  I
needed a bare module with a single class that I could programmatically
throw at a master, and then verify had successfully been applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-solution-s"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Solution(s)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it's impossible to verify that the unicode isn't showing up
because it's unicode, and not because I goofed on adding the class
(yeah, yeah, our logging could be improved), I first needed to get
this test working with a kosher name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="files"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Files&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so really the crux of this problems is what files you need, and
where they need to go on your system.  Since this requires just &lt;em&gt;the one
class&lt;/em&gt;, and none of the other infra around puppetized applications,
only a simple &lt;code&gt;init.pp&lt;/code&gt; is necessary.  Mine looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code puppet literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;myclass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'/tmp/make_sure_this_exists'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;ensure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;present&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few important notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No trailing whitespace! Anywhere!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 spaces, not tab characters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single quotes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.puppet.com/guides/style_guide.html"&gt;more official style guideline&lt;/a&gt;, and even a
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://puppet-lint.com/"&gt;puppet-linter&lt;/a&gt; you can use to verify your &lt;code&gt;init.pp&lt;/code&gt; is
correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so we've got this file, where does it go on the master?  As far as
I can tell most Puppet-y things that we humans deal with live in
&lt;code&gt;/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments&lt;/code&gt;, and since we're taking the
easy road here we're going to be working in the &lt;code&gt;production&lt;/code&gt;
environment. Before you do anything that directory should look
something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
.
└── production
    ├── environment.conf
    ├── hieradata
    ├── manifests
    │&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; └── site.pp
    └── modules
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modules&lt;/strong&gt; is going to be the directory we need to work with.  A
puppet module is a self-contained bundle of code you use to tell
puppet some part of how you want your system to look. There are huge,
widely used puppet modules such as &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/apache"&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt;, or there are cute little
5-line modules like ours, and both specify various related aspects of
a system state to achieve a goal.  That's as much as I'll say about
modules, but you can &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/reference/modules_fundamentals.html"&gt;read more here&lt;/a&gt; if interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: In order for agents to be classified by this class, it needs
to go on the master.  This might not be strictly true all of the time,
but it definitely wasn't going to show up in the GUI or get applied to
agents from another agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="doing-the-thing-manually"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Doing the Thing Manually&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make the directory&lt;/strong&gt;. To make our module, we'll need to make the
following directory from the &lt;code&gt;production&lt;/code&gt; directory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
mkdir -p modules/myclass/manifests`
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;myclass&lt;/code&gt; matches the class name you have in your
&lt;code&gt;init.pp&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copy the file&lt;/strong&gt;. Then put the &lt;code&gt;init.pp&lt;/code&gt; in that directory,
and your set!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verify it worked&lt;/strong&gt;. There are a few ways to verify that you were
successful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSH into the master, run &lt;code&gt;puppet agent -t&lt;/code&gt;, then SSH into your
agent and verify that the file &lt;code&gt;/tmp/make_sure_this_exists&lt;/code&gt;
does indeed exist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the GUI, head to Nodes &amp;gt; Classification, create a new group, then
go to $node_group_page &amp;gt; classes tab and verify your class is in the
dropdown for adding a class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="automate-it"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Automate it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now that we know what we're doing, automating it with Beaker is
pretty easy, especially if we're working in the production
environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make the directory&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code ruby literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="vi"&gt;&amp;#64;class_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'classy'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="vi"&gt;&amp;#64;modules_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;&amp;#64;class_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/manifests&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;master&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;mkdir -p &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;&amp;#64;modules_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copy the file&lt;/strong&gt;. Please note, I needed to define my
&lt;code&gt;init.pp&lt;/code&gt; content inside the file for reasons, but you can
also have a local file and use ruby to read from it, which is a
little more best-practice-y. Also note that you'll need to give the
file proper permissions once you've made it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code ruby literal-block"&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;manifest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;lt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;EOS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sh"&gt;class #{&amp;#64;class_name} {
  file { '/tmp/make_sure_this_exists':
    ensure =&amp;gt; present
  }
}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;  EOS
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;create_remote_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;master&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;&amp;#64;modules_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/init.pp&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;manifest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;master&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;chmod 644 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;&amp;#64;modules_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/init.pp&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verify that it worked&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code ruby literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;master&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'puppet agent -t'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;agent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;agents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;find&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;agent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;not_controller&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;agent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;ls_output&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;agent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'ls /tmp/make_sure_this_exists'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;stdout&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;assert_equal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ls_output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'/tmp/make_sure_this_exists'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;error_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of ways to verify that it worked, this runs
&lt;code&gt;puppet agent -t&lt;/code&gt; on the master (which compiles the catalog and
applies it to all the agents), then verifies that the output of 'ls'
on the master includes the file our class put there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this was helpful and what you are looking for! This is
really the &lt;em&gt;bare minimum&lt;/em&gt;, need-to-know-basis level of creating a
custom class, for when you just need to get the thing done and don't
want to learn &lt;strong&gt;All Of Puppet&lt;/strong&gt;.  If you do want to learn all of
puppet though, there are some links below!  Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

Fall is here, in case you hadn't noticed yet, and
with rainy Sundays and long bus rides to school ahead it's time to
pick up some easy reads. Make some tea, cozy up, and crack a book!
Here's what I've been reading and loving:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/amy-schumer-book.jpg" style="height: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29405093-the-girl-with-the-lower-back-tattoo"&gt;The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo&lt;/a&gt; by Amy
Schumer. Not just
another comedian's memoir, Amy's book offers fascinating insight into
how she became the person (and celebrity) she is today.  With
heartbreaking stories and a sprinkling of levity, this might be my
favorite read of the year to date.  You can read more of my thoughts
on the book &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/tgwtlbt.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/american-housewife.jpg" style="height: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25472765-american-housewife"&gt;American Housewife&lt;/a&gt; by Helen Ellis.  This is a quirky yet
relatable collection of short stories about what it means to be a
modern woman.  My favorite story was hands down The Fitter, but each
is a gem unto itself.  Want to know what it's about? You know how to
find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/hunger-makes-me.jpg" style="height: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25065629-hunger-makes-me-a-modern-girl"&gt;Hunger Makes Me a Modern Girl&lt;/a&gt; by Carrie Brownstein. True to form
I love me a good memoir, and Carrie's was the perfect scratch
for my itch. Like Amy Schumer's memoir, HMMaMG is raw and
unapologetic, describing some of the hardest parts of her life and
how she came to be the person she is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/when-breath.jpg" style="height: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25899336-when-breath-becomes-air"&gt;When Breath Becomes Air&lt;/a&gt; by Paul Kalanithi. I didn't know much
about this book going in, but was stunned by the eloquence and voice
of Paul's writing. His story is interesting and deeply sad, and I
found myself crying on the way to class at the end. Definitely a
short but worthwhile read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/the-assistants.jpg" style="height: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26067909-the-assistants"&gt;The Assistants&lt;/a&gt; by Camille Perri. Part office gossip, part juicy
crime novel, I couldn't read this book fast enough.  I loved Camille's
characters, the genius (and not contrived) story, the setting and
conflicts and intimacies of people we work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/shrill.jpg" style="height: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29340182-shrill"&gt;Shrill&lt;/a&gt; by Lindy West. A reminder that we are all human beings, and
that we need to treat each other accordingly. But told really, really
well. Seriously, just read it, and become the better person you know
you can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it!  Happy reading beautiful people, and as always feel free to
email¹ me at wyman(dot)lucy(at)gmail(dot)com with any book
recommendations of your own, comments, or concerns!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 I don't have a comments section on my blog because I find they often
become ugly places on the internet. I'm not saying &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; would write
anything terrible, but it just felt like asking for trouble. You can
always reach out to me via email!&lt;/p&gt;

had little background on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Valenti"&gt;Jessica Valenti&lt;/a&gt;.  I knew it was branded
as 'Feminist', whatever that means, but didn't know much else going
in.  Unlike many books I finish, my feelings about it are complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is a chronicle of terrible experiences she has had around
gender, from getting cat-called, to being in abusive relationships,
to getting death threats on the internet.  While I identified with a
number of her experiences and appreciated that her book made me
think more about how I'm treated, I finished it feeling sad and very
much tired of talking about gender.  There's no call to action or
even real cause-effect to her stories. It's just the stories as they
happened, told like the script for a movie: all facts, with little
&amp;quot;Here's how this &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have happened&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Here's what you, as a
man, woman, or child, can do&amp;quot; or even &amp;quot;Here's how I wish I had
reacted&amp;quot;.  I find so often that when &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.lucywyman.me/boy.html"&gt;men don't treat me with
respect&lt;/a&gt; I have no idea how to react in the moment, and wish that
she had provided some guidance or thoughts there.  In the end, she
was only telling me things I already knew with no revelatory
thoughts.  Her book didn't change how I see her, how I see the
world, how I react to various situations, or how I understand gender
or being a woman.  Perhaps she was targeting those who don't even
realize what misogyny looks like, or how common aggression is, but
honestly those people are not the same people who are going to be
reading her book. The people who are going to read her book are
people like me, who know and recognize that they are frequently
treated like sex objects.  In the end, I feel sorry for how
extremely unpleasant many of her experiences are, and that there's
little or nothing she and I can do about it, but I didn't need to
read this book to understand that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for other great reads by great women, I'd
recommend picking up Amy Schumer's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29405093-the-girl-with-the-lower-back-tattoo"&gt;The Girl with the Lower Back
Tattoo&lt;/a&gt;, Jenny Lawson's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23848559-furiously-happy"&gt;Furiously Happy&lt;/a&gt;, Mindy Kaling's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10335308-is-everyone-hanging-out-without-me"&gt;Is
Everyone Hanging Out Without Me&lt;/a&gt;, or Lindy West's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29340182-shrill"&gt;Shrill&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit (10/11/2016):&lt;/strong&gt; I've meditated on the purpose of 'Sex Object'
since writing this, and I think there are a few possible and very
worthwhile reasons she wrote it. First and foremost is to process,
understand, and ultimately come to terms with her experiences.  I hope
she found some modicum (however small) of peace or catharsis in
writing the book.  Second, though, I think it is to tell other women
they are not alone. That sexism and degradation are systemic,
pervasive, and that it is not &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;their fault&lt;/em&gt;.  I know for
many women, including my own mother, the issue of blame and cause is
placed on them instead of the actual actors and perpetrators.  I also want to
acknowledge that to some extent my critique is unrealistic: there
&lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; a solution, an action I should have taken or can take in the
future, to make this better.  There is no call to action because the
best any of us can do is exactly what she did: talk about it, openly
and frankly, and about why it's wrong.  In the end, I think the book
left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth, but I don't think that's
Jessica Valenti's fault, or any reason to not read her book. If
anything, it's a reason you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; read her book.&lt;/p&gt;

books.  This is in part because so much of my attention was directed at my
new job, in part because nothing I was really excited to read came in, in
part because I was spending a lot of time with my boyfriend before he went
back to school.  But I was ready to break my reading-lull when Amy Schumer's
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29405093-the-girl-with-the-lower-back-tattoo"&gt;The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo&lt;/a&gt; showed up in my reading queue.  Amy
Schumer's not someone I pin all of my feminist hopes and dreams (and labels)
to, but I do appreciate her work and many of the ideas she promotes. Needless
to say I was very excited to read her book (the latest in a long list of
biographies I have read and loved!), and it did not disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TGwtLBT is just as much about the hard, scary, sad parts of Amy's life as it
is about the funny, awkward, we've-all-had-this-happen experiences she's had.
Ultimately it's about the experiences that shaped the person and celebrity
she is today, told honestly and sprinkled with humor.  What made the book
stand out was that she wasn't &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to be funny. Often comedian's books
become comedy sets, told in book form. This is fine to an extent, but offers
no insight into who that person is, or what unique experiences they've had.
Instead of trying to make you laugh Amy tells her story as it is, throwing in
jokes and levity where appropriate without sacrificing the integrity of the
book.  More than a fun pick-me-up read, Amy's book helped me understand how
to interact with the mentally ill, how to handle sexist comments, how to be a
person in the world just a tiny bit better.  If you haven't got your hands on
a copy yet, I can't recommend it enough!&lt;/p&gt;

STEM. In high school all of my classes were relatively 50-50 in terms of
gender, including science and math classes, and I had never experienced or
noticed anyone treating me differently than my male peers.  My fist computer
science class at university was ~5% female¹, and as I started to consume more tech media (ie. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/"&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;)
it became clear the Oregon State was not an exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after 3 years of classes like this, I'm really not sure how to feel about
the dearth of diversity in STEM.  But regardless of the emotions I cycle
through or the discussions I have with people, one question that frequently
gets asked is whether people treat me differently because I'm a
woman,or whether
I'm discriminated against. The answer is yes, of course: it's natural that
people treat me differently because I'm a (very feminine) woman, but more than
that I want to address the skeptical tone people take when they ask if I
experience discrimination.  My intention here isn't to shame people for their
skepticism, compare my experiences to those of others, or have this be a &amp;quot;Woe
is me!&amp;quot; post. But I want my peers to be aware that I do experience
discrimination, and have a variety of negative and uncomfortable experiences
that would likely not have happened, or had the same negative meaning, if I
were a boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="etherpad"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Etherpad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://etherpad.osuosl.org"&gt;etherpads&lt;/a&gt; to organize events for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://lug.oregonstate.edu"&gt;Linux Users Group&lt;/a&gt;, and
each new user can identify themselves manually on the etherpad.  However
everyone has access to each name input, so a single user can put whatever
they'd like as each person's name.  Since most new users don't know about
this feature, or don't care to put their name in, often one person will
put their own name in each name input, so it looks like there are 10
'Elis' all talking to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/etherpad-identify.png" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when planning meetings for LUG this term I took the liberty of doing
this, putting my own name in each of the name inputs.  Later that day
I reopened the etherpad to find the following text at the bottom
of the page: &amp;quot;Lucys been a naughty gurl. She gun get fired&amp;quot;.
I'm confident that the note was a very poorly done joke, meant
to be harmless and completely missing the mark. But it was
humiliating nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-bus"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Bus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A male colleague and I were on a bus from Corvallis to Portland, and happened
to be the only people on the bus.  Almost a year earlier we had lightly flirted
in our interactions, but we had never done anything and since that time I had
started seriously (and monogamously) dating my boyfriend. So, the colleague and
I were sitting together, first chatting then watching a movie.  He would
occassionally make uncomfortable comments like &amp;quot;I wouldn't mind seeing you
naked&amp;quot;, but I would just ignore them and forge ahead in the conversation,
thinking them relatively harmless. Then when the movie started he picked my
hand up and put it on his upper thigh. Despite being only a 1.5 hour ride, it
felt like the longest of my life. In all fairness I could have dealt with it
much better: I was stunned and had no idea what to do, so ended up using the
computer as an excuse to remove my hand then just tried to keep to myself and
keep distracted for the rest of the ride, never telling him how uncomfortable
that had made me or that it wasn't ok with me.  In retrospect, I should have
said something. Then again, it probably shouldn't have happened in the first
place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-maker-fair"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Maker Fair&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was manning a Lego Robotics booth at the Corvallis Maker Fair.
I had a little demo set up, and spiel about what my organization did, and
spent most of the day showing kids how to program the robots and talking
to very kind parents. As a swarm of kids left the table, one of the event
organizers asked if he could get a short clip of me explaining the demo
and then showing how it worked, and I said sure.  I did the thing, he took
the video, then left with his wife to see other exhibits. A nearby
man who had seen the exchange came up, and after I started giving my spiel
he stopped me mid sentence and said &amp;quot;You know he just wanted your picture, right?&amp;quot;.
Lost for words, I think I just gaped, then turned to someone else and started
helping them with something.  His comment made me so uncomfortable, and
marred what had been a great morning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-21st-birthday"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The 21st Birthday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now I had graduated from university, but was visiting Corvallis to see my
boyfriend and celebrate his roommate's 21st birthday.  It was a Friday night,
and as we were touring the bars and restaurants of Corvallis we met a few
people who were friends-of-friends. This resulted in a group of 8-10 people
eating at a pizza joint, only some of whom I knew personally. After long
conversations that I had a hard time contributing to, I found a tiny foothold
for myself: &amp;quot;Oh, yeah, I used to love that mine game...mine stopper?&amp;quot;.
&amp;quot;Minesweeper&amp;quot; my friend said. Then, a voice down the table from someone I
didn't know said &amp;quot;No worries, it's got a lot of numbers in it&amp;quot;. I hope that he
didn't mean to imply that a game with lots of numbers in it would be hard for
me to remember, enjoy, or be good at. But in the moment it felt like I was
being pushed even further out of a conversation I was already not a part of,
and like that &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; what he was implying.  I left shortly after, holding back
tears, and was told that I should have just said &amp;quot;Fuck you&amp;quot; to the guy and
carried on.  I shouldn't have let it ruin the evening, and should have asserted
that it wasn't an OK thing to say.  But why is that burden on me?  Why didn't
my friends defend me, or even notice that I was visibly upset at the comment?
Why didn't anyone else think it wasn't OK?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I'm working in the real world, I realize what being treated equally is
like. I love my job, and am a respected colleague at my workplace.  People who
have been in the industry since I was born ask for my opinion, have me review
their work, and I never second guess my standing among them. This makes
discrimination that much clearer to me: each time someone doesn't assume I'm
their equal, it stands out.  It stings. In so many ways, I wish I could go back
to when I didn't notice it. When a comment like that could have been totally
innocuous.  But it's not, anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-little-things"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Little Things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;09/20/2016&lt;/strong&gt;: I walk to work everyday, going down Belmont and
crossing the Morrison Bridge. I usually leave between 7:30 and 8,
when it's definitely light outside and there are lots of other
people walking, biking, and driving the same direction.  I listen to
a variety of books and podcasts, and am literally wearing
clothes appropriate for a professional work environment (not that it
matters, but I just want to set the scene here and provide context).
About half way through my walk a construction truck was stopped at a
red light, and as I waited at the same red light one of the men in
the truck wolf-whistled (loud enough to hear through my headphones),
then the other yelled &amp;quot;Nice ass, honey!&amp;quot;.  I ignored them,
pretending I hadn't heard, but they're comments got weirdly in my
head. &amp;quot;Were these jeans not appropriate?  I didn't even put makeup
on this morning, why are you yelling at me?  Can I melt into the
ground right now?&amp;quot;  I realized that I was blaming myself for what
they had said, and wondering what I could do to avoid it in the
future.  Wear baggier clothes? Maybe I should take the bus?  I
talked to another female co-worker about it once I got to work, and
she helped me feel better about it. It wasn't my fault, it didn't
reflect on me at all, it was just two guys who decided to be
assholes and make comments about me on my walk into work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;09/29/2016&lt;/strong&gt;: A female friend and I went to see &amp;quot;The Music of
David Bowie: The Oregon Symphony&amp;quot; at the Schnitz. It was a
&lt;em&gt;wonderful&lt;/em&gt; concert, and as we were walking back to my car, we both
had our phones out looking up directions to my friend's apartment. A
man tapped one of us on the shoulder and said &amp;quot;Were you ladies
filming in there? I'm going to have to confiscate your phones.&amp;quot;  We
both looked at each other terrified.  Were you...? No, neither of us
had our phones out at all during the concert. We shook our heads
&amp;quot;No, we didn't do anything&amp;quot;, then he laughed and said &amp;quot;I'm just
kidding, you ladies both look beautiful tonight&amp;quot;.  We speed walked
away, both totally uncomfortable and dreading the long walk to the
car in the dark. The true skeptic may be thinking &amp;quot;He complimented
you. Why is this a bad thing?&amp;quot;  Well,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;02/24/2017&lt;/strong&gt;: In a meeting today the QA team was discussing
changes to our interview process. At one point a male coworker was
referring to potential candidates and said &amp;quot;The guy won't get XYZ.
He might not think to do ABC.&amp;quot; and went on to continue referring
potential candidates as exclusively male for the rest of the
meeting. It's such a small thing, and I almost brought it up and
pointed it out, but I know he's not doing it intentionally. But it
does make clear that we unconsciously think of engineers as being
male.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experiences are my own and don't necessarily reflect or represent those
of all women in STEM fields, but I hope they do humanize the diversity
struggle in those industries and highlight the ways in which sexism is
still happening.  It's not all bad: I have always received equal pay for
equal work to my male peers, am respected within the community, and
have never felt that I was denied an opportunity, promotion, or
position because I am a woman. At the same time none of the above
experiences would have happened if I were a boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="further-reading"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Further Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I'm not the first or last technical lady to have these
experiences. You can read about others experiences with discrimination
in tech here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;1 This number comes from me very unscientifically counting the number&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;of people in class who appeared to be female and asking the professor
how many students total were in the class.  I understand that appearance
is not an indicator of gender, and there's possibly errors in
mis-identifying individuals, particularly if they're not gender binary.
I apologize for this, but the point remains the same: the class was
&lt;em&gt;dominated&lt;/em&gt; by male humans&lt;/dd&gt;

This is my personal guide to the beautiful city of
Portland. Whether you're local and looking to try something new, or
visiting and wondering where the good stuff is, this is a list of my
favorite places in the city. Adventure on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="places"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Places&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="powell-s-books"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.powells.com/"&gt;Powell's Books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the digital age, as book stores around the world close their doors,
Powell's remains a thriving hub of literature.  Even if you haven't
picked up a book in years, Powell's will remind you of the power books
have over us, and make you thirsty for knowledge.  You'll be wandering
aimlessly, not sure what there is for you there, then find yourself
thinking 'I bet that vegetarian cookbook would help me cook at home
more instead of getting takeout', or 'Oooo, I haven't read Phillip K.
Dick in years. I used to love his books', and the game is over. The
book worm, occasional beach reader, skeptical technophile,
wonder-filled child, and dormant literature lover will inevitably find
themselves drawn to one of Powell's 1 million books and fall in love
all over again.  Even if you just come for the corgi-socks, it's worth
the visit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="rose-test-garden"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Rose Test Garden&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Rose Test Garden is one of the most traditionally
beautiful places in Portland.  With several football fields of roses
and several hundred million types of roses, it's easy to lose all
sense of time and space amidst the fragrance and brilliance of the
Rose Test Garden. All kidding aside, the RTG is a must during the
summer months when roses are in full bloom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="serra"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://shopserra.com/"&gt;Serra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right, marijuana is legal in Oregon now, which has resulted in
some of the &lt;em&gt;cutest&lt;/em&gt; and friendliest shops popping up around town. I
think there are a few things that make marijuana shops super great:
1. They're combatting some pretty harsh cultural taboos. Pot is still frequently seen as &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; or seedy (see my parents reaction when they read this post), so the best marijuana stores combat that by being very well lit, open spaces that are &lt;em&gt;beautifully&lt;/em&gt; designed. The staff are often very friendly and knowledgeable too, so you don't need to feel uncool for asking a million questions or leave without knowing what you're putting in your body.
2. Everything is local, by necessity. Because marijuana isn't legal in other states it can't cross state lines, even if it's legal in both of those states (ie. Oregon and Washington). This means you're by default supporting amazing local businesses who are often supplying 100% locally made and extremely high quality products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love Serra because it epitomizes both of these qualities. All of
their shops are in gorgeous old buildings, and are staffed with folks
who will stand there for &lt;em&gt;literally hours&lt;/em&gt; answering all your
questions about strains and chemicals and neurology and side effects.
And honestly you guys, I like consuming (not smoking) marijuana &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt;
much more than drinking. Beyond a glass or two of wine alcohol really
doesn't agree with my system, and has ruined a few nights and
mornings. Marijuana doesn't have those terrible physical side
effects, and provides equally enjoyable inebriation in the right
doses. If you're in town and haven't tried it yet, I highly (ha)
recommend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bagdad-theater"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.mcmenamins.com/bagdad-theater-pub"&gt;Bagdad Theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.mcmenamins.com/"&gt;McMenamin's&lt;/a&gt; is more than a brewery, but an eclectic variety of
refurbished vintage buildings providing places for communities to
gather. The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.mcmenamins.com/bagdad-theater-pub"&gt;Bagdad Theater&lt;/a&gt; is one such place. Located at the heart of
Hawthorne, the Bagdad is the perfect &amp;quot;Portland&amp;quot; place for dinner, a
movie, or both! When my SO was living in Portland over the summer we
would go there almost every Saturday, get a large order of tater tots,
and enjoy the movies they screened there. It's a staple of our lives,
and a staple of Portland culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ground-kontrol"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://groundkontrol.com/"&gt;Ground Kontrol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most big cities have classic arcades, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://groundkontrol.com/"&gt;Ground Kontrol&lt;/a&gt; is ours.
With about a million pinball machines, classics like DDR and
Ms.Pacman, and newer games like Killer Queen, GK has something for
everyone. Bring your quarters and forget your troubles for a few
hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="food"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="e-san-thai"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://esanthai.com/"&gt;E-San Thai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The food may just be OK, but E-San has a special place in my heart.
My co-workers and I often go there for lunch on Fridays, and I have so
many fond memories of us squeezing 10-18 people into their loft,
laughing together and enjoying a meal. I always get the same thing
(Pad See Ew with Carrots) and have never tired of it! It may seem
blase at first, but take your time at E-San. Admire the old wood and
sturdy construction, the elaborate decorations, the scratches in the
tables and floor that let you know this place is &lt;em&gt;lived in&lt;/em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dcvegetarian.com/"&gt;DC Vegetarian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portland is also known for it's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.foodcartsportland.com/"&gt;Food Carts&lt;/a&gt;, and while I can't say
I've tried enough to tell you what that best in the city are, I will
tell you that whenever I go to a food cart for lunch it is always to
DC Vegetarian on 3rd and Alder. Their vegetarian and vegan
sandwiches are better than their meaty counterparts, and my
go-to meal is just $5.50, the cheapest lunch you can get downtown at
lunch hour. I highly recommend the vegan BLT, with avocado of course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="blue-star-donuts"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.bluestardonuts.com/"&gt;Blue Star Donuts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's my duty as a native Portlander to tell you that &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.voodoodoughnut.com/"&gt;VooDoo donuts&lt;/a&gt; are
entirely overrated, and that if you really want the Portland Donut
Experience you absolutely must go to Blue Star. With classic and
exotic flavors, Blue Star donuts are fresh and doughy, not too sweet,
and 100% satisfying. My personal favorite is the Blueberry Bourbon
Basil, but you'll just have to try them all to see which is your
favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="cacao"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cacaodrinkchocolate.com/"&gt;Cacao&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drinkable. Chocolate. Need I say more? Cacao is a super fancy
chocolate place, with a few locations throughout Portland. They have
all the high-quality chocolate your heart could desire, fancy people
who use words like &amp;quot;earthy&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;floral&amp;quot; to tell you about it, and did
I mention the drinkable chocolate?  Warning: you will be consistently
disappointed in hot chocolate after going here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Cannoli. I was very skeptical of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_Before_You"&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; when I picked it
up. I originally saw it at Powell's and put it on my to-read list, but
then those &lt;em&gt;sappy&lt;/em&gt; ads began running a few weeks later and I got
worried.  Don't let the ads fool you though: this was a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; novel.
I laughed. I cried. I finished it in two days.  The book follows
Louisa Clark, a recently unemployed barista who needs a job to help
her family make ends meet. She takes a job as a sort of low-level
care-giver for a quadriplegic man named Will Traynor, and soon finds
out that he plans to carry out assisted suicide in a few months.  She
takes that time to try to convince him that life, even in a wheelchair
with limited mobility, is worth living, a task which ends up taking
the couple on some (mis)adventures.  It's...kind of a love story?
There's definitely romance. But also &lt;em&gt;so much more&lt;/em&gt;.  As an
able-bodied person, we so rarely think about accessibility, and
increasing the comfort and quality of life for those with
disabilities.  I had never thought about how hard navigating the mall
would be in a wheel chair, how it would feel to not be able to
exercise, and how out of control every aspect of life would be. This
read definitely changed my view of disability, and gave me a lot of
appreciation and gratitude for my body.  It sounds heavy now, but this
book is &lt;em&gt;juicy&lt;/em&gt; as well. 100% page turner.  Definitely worth putting
on your summer list!&lt;/p&gt;

The book follows a middle class
woman, Evelyn, trying to break into the hyper-rich socialite society
she grew up on the fringes of.  Her life spirals completely out of
control, and it's all about how she deals with it. This book was
totally about expectations, and it 100% met my expectations of a fun
summer read.  It was definitely entertaining, interesting characters,
and a very satisfying ending. If you like girly fun reads like me,
this is definitely worth putting on your summer list!&lt;/p&gt;

Although I don't write as much
documentation as I should, writing is such a key part of day-to-day human
interaction, and WTD is always a good reminder of basic principles and
encouragement to write more (docs).  It's also an incredibly well run
conference, done through trial and error. Every year they try new things, and
keep the things that work.  It's also one-track, which has pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt;:
* Everyone has the same experience, and it's easy to discuss
* You don't need to make any decisions or miss great talks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;:
* You have to sit through some sub-optimal talks
* Less walking and time between sessions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTD is also held at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mcmenamins.com/CrystalBallroom"&gt;Crystal Ballroom&lt;/a&gt; in Portland, which is a great
venue.  It's friendly. It's not corporate-y. Good vibes all around. There were
also talks. I wrote about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Side Note:&lt;/strong&gt; There were many well-dressed humans, who had very well designed
[clothes | bags | accessories]. It was wonderful to get out of the university
fashion bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="day-1"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="open-source-docs-in-federal-gov-t"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Open Source Docs in Federal Gov't&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Britta Gustafson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contributing to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/whitehouse"&gt;government software&lt;/a&gt; was a thought that had never crossed my
mind, and it turns out that not &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the governments software is horrible and
outdated.  In fact, they have a lot of really cool and interesting APIs, and
are incredibly immersed in Open Source.  Britta recently became a federal
employee, working for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/GSA"&gt;General Services Agency (GSA)&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/18F"&gt;18F&lt;/a&gt;, and
she gave a compelling talk on why contributing to the government helps you help
others.  We often think of the government as a crufty old gross thing that
takes our money and makes bad decisions. But if we want that to change, we
&lt;em&gt;have the power&lt;/em&gt;, especially as software developers. Being part of that
ecosystem can help strengthen a weak and imperfect system, and do good for a
lot of people. All good things to think about, and really a core part of open
source. Great talk, great speaker, great topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="customer-support-docs"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Customer Support + Docs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neal Kaplan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a rough talk. It can really be summed up in one sentence: If you write
docs, you should talk to your customers and customer support team more to get a
feel for what customers need and what your docs are missing.  A good point, but
not a half-hour long point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="documenting-apis"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Documenting APIs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allison Reinheimer Moore&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allison's talk was well put together and well-rehearsed, but without many
memorable takeaways. APIs are so diverse that this is an understandably
difficult talk to execute, and I recall it being unfortunately general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="collaboration-between-open-source-corporate-software"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Collaboration Between Open Source + Corporate Software&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shaun McCance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaun's talk was primarily a call to action for professional technical writers
to help the open source projects they use write good documentation. Often
community members are working on open source projects just for fun, and most
developers don't find writing docs very fun. Understandably. So, as paid people
who use words, if you're already writing docs for something, why not contribute
that to open source?  It strengthens both products, makes the world better,
unicorns poop rainbows, yay.  This was another talk that could really have been
5 minutes of &amp;quot;Hey, here's a thought you might not have had, do the things!&amp;quot;,
but it's a thesis I totally agree with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="lunch"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lunch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually lunch doesn't get it's own section, but lunch at WTD was &lt;em&gt;bomb&lt;/em&gt;. There
was Caesar salad. Fresh veggies + fruit. And pasta with tomatoes, spinach, and
hazelnuts. &lt;strong&gt;So good&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="lightning-talks"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lightning Talks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="dialog-trees"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Dialog Trees&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A talk on tool for making effective dialog trees for video games, specifically
Yarn.  Something I know nothing about, and very well done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="lektor"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Lektor&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Static-site CMS? It's a thing. SSG with dynamic admin site. It seems pretty
cool. Possible fodder for travel blog.  Maybe best talk of the day in terms of
content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="cats-the-perfect-pets"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Cats: The perfect pets&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pantheon"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Pantheon&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not even sure what this talk was about.  It happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="copy-that-helping-users-succeed-with-copy"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Copy That: Helping Users Succeed with Copy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation for people who don't read documentation!  Product copy is the
words you use in the product to guide users, like the label on a button, the
title of a page, etc.  It's definitely one of those things that I don't think
about as often as I should, and was wonderfully specific and detailed.  Sarah
pulled up a page from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://goodreads.com"&gt;GoodReads&lt;/a&gt; and talked about the use and misuse of copy
on that page. There were diagrams, circles, and it was a very well-practiced
and tight talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="readable-readme"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Readable README&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel Beck&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="more-zen"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More Zen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tana Franko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gentle reminder of a few often-heard principles that are easy to forget.
Reframe how you think of problems. Simplify your work. Don't forget to have
hobbies.  This was a very successful and loosey-goosey 15 minute talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="embed-the-docs"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Embed the Docs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kristof Von Tomme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another 15 minute &amp;quot;Thunderstorm&amp;quot;, this time on how important copy is.  Less
well done than the previous copy talk, but no less important a message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="writing-so-your-words-are-read"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Writing So Your Words Are Read&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracy Osborn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long and kind of interesting story?  Not to disrespect Tracy, but stripping out
the self-congratulation at the beginning and giving context in a slide or two
would be much better. Her point of &amp;quot;Know your audience, they aren't necessarily
&lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; is a good one, but again not worthy of a full half hour.  She also makes
a lot of assumptions about how technical people write, which are completely
false in my experience.  I'm definitely not the right audience for this talk,
and as such didn't get much out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="panel-transforming-your-doc-process"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Panel: Transforming Your Doc Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel was probably fine? I don't know, I was really tired + over caffeinated
and in desperate need of food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="day-2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-writing-fiction-teaches-you-about-writing-documentation"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Writing Fiction Teaches You About Writing Documentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday Bram&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday takes principles that everyone (even me -- really, &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;) has
heard when writing fiction and talks about how you can apply it to writing
documentation. It was more effective (for me personally) as a review of writing
principles, but was a very entertaining and example-filled presentation none
the less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="values-of-effective-tech-writing-teams"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7 Values of Effective Tech Writing Teams&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joao Fernandes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thesis: Help build products that need no documentation. In-app help, buttons |
labels | tooltips, clear copy, etc. A few of the same ideas  we've heard
repeated at the conference: be brief, be concise, work with your team, know
your audience &amp;amp; product &amp;amp; market, etc. But, if I had to choose &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of the
talks that covered these topics, it would be this one. The slides were
&lt;em&gt;gorgeous&lt;/em&gt;, and the speaker was relatively charismatic if a bit monotone.  He
also did an interesting thing where he would introduce an practice, then
explain what would happen if you didn't adopt that practice, which seemed more
effective &amp;amp; interesting than just saying to do the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="building-documentation-culture-in-startups"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Building Documentation Culture in Startups&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruthie BenDor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk of the day!  Ruthie is an engineer with a range of experiences, and this
was basically story time of good and bad experiences with docs.  She's a great
storyteller, really interesting tales with good morals &amp;amp; takeaways, and very
funny.  She also covered a 4-step guide to creating great internal docs that's
general and applicable to any org. Super talk!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="following-the-technical-doc-road"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Following the Technical Doc Road&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christy Lutz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very cute Wizard of Oz themed inspiration speech. Believe in yourself, work
with your team, etc. Funny + well-executed + entertaining + ideal for 15 minute
talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="using-csat-data"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Using CSAT Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Betsy Roseberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSAT == Customer Satisfaction.  This was mostly about the value of having
on-page user feedback + comment forms in your docs, and how to use that
feedback productively. Excellent 15 minute talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="just-in-time-documentation"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Just-In-Time Documentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brianne Hillmer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thesis: write your documentation when you know what problems your customers
are having, don't try to guess what problems they will have in the future.
This ends up being lots of short articles like &amp;quot;There's a gear button in the
top left that looks little but actually takes you to what you want&amp;quot; that are
only 2-3 paragraphs, but are exactly what people need. Overall very well
executed, and especially able to keep the audience focused while smelling
Burrito lunch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="id1"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lightning Talks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="organizing-meetups"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Organizing Meetups&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely valuable if you're looking to start a meet-up, and the speaker seems
like a very sweet if not well-spoken man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="documentation-in-academia"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Documentation in Academia&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given by my hilarious co-worker Jack, I'm 100% biased here. But like everything
Jack does I thought it was clever, funny, and educational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="earning-user-trust"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Earning User Trust&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="interactive-document-environments"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Interactive Document Environments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim Nugent &amp;amp; Paris Buttfield-Addison&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also a great talk! Interactive Documentation Environments are Code + Notes +
Docs, and are a very pretty way of rendering and compiling together those
three things into kind of actual docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="accessible-math-on-the-web"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Accessible Math on the Web&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim Arnold&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MathJax + MathML. If you haven't looked into them, you should!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="oops-i-became-an-engineer"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Oops, I Became an Engineer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tara Scherner de la Fuente&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#64;goatuserstories is a funny twitter. Follow your dreams! Consider community
college! Win + profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="main-takeaways"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Main Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider working for the government. It won't get better by you being angry
at it, and they actually do some very cool things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What's the current state of your internal docs? It's so easy to focus on external
docs, but your employees need docs too! A good litmus test is how long it takes
a new hire to get their first PR up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look out for Lektor and Interactive Documentation Environments. The future
is bright and beautiful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember your basic writing and humaning principles: know your audience;
be brief; ask questions; have respect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

who at 36, on the verge of completing his residency to become
a neurosurgeon, is diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. Written
in his last year of life, the book is about coming to terms with
death and living a meaningful life, through the eyes of both a

Paul's voice and writing are absolutely stunning. The content
as well as delivery are beautiful, and I found myself crying

Summer is upon us, and with long sunny days ahead
you know you'll be tripping to Powell's to pick up some summer reads.
I wanted to make this a regular reading list with a variety of ficiton
and nonfiction books, and I realized that 90% of my choices were
biographies or memoirs.  If you're not into them, don't despair! There are
a few juicy fictional reads at the top of the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_potter_series"&gt;The Harry Potter Series&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on your appetite this series
can take a while, but I recently re-read the whole series and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/harry-potter-series.html"&gt;loved it&lt;/a&gt;.  Definitely worth revisiting if you haven't in a
while, or if you've never read them to begin with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Help"&gt;The Help&lt;/a&gt;. If you haven't already, you should.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/me-before-you"&gt;Me Before You&lt;/a&gt;. I know, I know, it's on every list. I was
skeptical too. But trust me, this book is &lt;em&gt;candy&lt;/em&gt;. Excellent for
any reader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_Weapons"&gt;Use of Weapons&lt;/a&gt;. Even if you aren't familiar with the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_series"&gt;Culture series&lt;/a&gt;,
and don't want to read all 9 books, Use of Weapons is a fantastic stand alone
novel.  The chapters alternate between going forwards in time and backwards,
the characters are impossibly rich and well written, and the twist at the
end will leave you speechless and teary-eyed. Even if you're not a sci-fi
buff, definitely worth reading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/books/committed-a-love-story/"&gt;Committed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/"&gt;Big Magic&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/books/eat-pray-love/"&gt;Eat, Pray, Love&lt;/a&gt;.
You've definitely heard of the last one, but
the first is &lt;em&gt;so much better&lt;/em&gt;. Elizabeth Gilbert is 100% my favorite author,
my guilty pleasure, my comfort food, and her voice is miraculous. I like her
non-fiction better than her fiction (just personally, no literary criticism
here), but anything she writes will definitely lift your day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://thebloggess.com/furiously-happy/"&gt;Furiously Happy&lt;/a&gt;. I'm not sure if this qualifies as a biography, but it
seems close enough. I've read &lt;em&gt;several&lt;/em&gt; comedic ladies biographies (
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/books/bossypants-by-tina-fey-review.html"&gt;Bossypants&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://amysaysyesplease.com/"&gt;Yes Please&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11230081-seriously-i-m-kidding"&gt;Seriously, I'm Kidding&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.avclub.com/review/mindy-kalingem-is-everyone-hanging-out-without-me--64875"&gt;Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) and though hilarious and
inspiring I find the story often gets lost in the authors trying to be
funny. Granted being funny in writing (even in an audiobook) is like marathon
level hard. But &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://thebloggess.com/"&gt;Jenny Lawson&lt;/a&gt; definitely pulls it off in her reading of
her second book &amp;quot;Furiously Happy&amp;quot;, and includes a lot of personal moments
that help plebs like me understand mental illness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://piperkerman.com/orange/about-the-book/"&gt;Orange is the New Black&lt;/a&gt;. I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; the show, but it definitely takes
a lot of artistic license. Piper's actual experience, though less exciting,
is fascinating and well-told.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anything by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sedaris#Bibliography"&gt;David Sedaris&lt;/a&gt;. I especially love &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holidays_on_Ice"&gt;Holidays on Ice&lt;/a&gt;, if you're
a Sedaris newbie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Audacity_of_Hope"&gt;The Audacity of Hope&lt;/a&gt;. Perfect for a quick weekend read, Obama's cool
personal story and charismatic voice make this feel good, palate-cleanser
sort of book. Remind yourself there's good in the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

and men's version (ie. deodorant, socks, haircuts, etc.). IMHO this
isn't sexist so much as acknowledgment that men and women are
physically different creatures, BUT, sometimes the men-version of a
thing is much better (for one reason or another) than the
lady-version, even if you identify as a lady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few things I like to buy the non-lady versions of, and
why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flannels&lt;/strong&gt;. They're often cheaper and always thicker, and while
the cut is slightly less flattering the men's cut definitely looks
great &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; will actually keep you warm. Mine are from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.jcpenney.com/g/st-johns-bay-men/N-bwo3yZ7h"&gt;St. John's
Bay&lt;/a&gt; (I promise they came in cuter colors when I bought them!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Underwear&lt;/strong&gt;. I have a medium-to-large sized + very round butt,
and underwear &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; rides up and I have to fidget and pull it
down all day long. Even ladies boyshorts do this, since they
still barely cover my actual butt.  Instead, I've been wearing
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.meundies.com/products/trunk"&gt;MeUndies Men's trunks&lt;/a&gt; for about a year now, and am never
looking back.  They last longer, don't squeeze my hips, provide
full coverage, and look really cute + sexy!  Well worth the
investment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hair Cuts&lt;/strong&gt;.  Considering the head of hair I have, I definitely
need to ask a barber first before having them cut my hair.  Even
certified curly-hair cutters find my hair daunting.  That
said, the best hair cut I ever got was from University Cuts
Barber Shop for ~$15. With curly hair, even fancy salon hair
cuts are very hit-or-miss, and there's nothing worse than
dropping $60 (or more) and having triangle hair.  Even dressers
certified by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.devacurl.com/"&gt;Deva Curl&lt;/a&gt; have not been up to the task!  Whether
due to bravery, styling skills, or sheer luck, I've had better
luck at barber shops.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sweat pants&lt;/strong&gt;. Though I enjoy the shape and fit and lady-cut
jeans, I want my sweat pants to baggy, comfy, soft, and roomy. I'm
not trying to impress anyone here, I just need my body covered and
warm. I ordered a pair of lady sweats in a large from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.american-giant.com/"&gt;American
Giant&lt;/a&gt;, and though stretchy they were fitted! From booty to
mid-shin, the sweats were right up against my skin, with none of
the desired baggy roomy comfiness. I don't need to be feeling a hug
around my upper thighs all day. Conversely, my boyfriend's size
medium sweats fit me perfectly -- they give me plenty of room to
move in, are thicker, and don't show whether I'm wearing underwear
or not. And I can say I'm a medium :D . So we traded sweats (since
the larges were baggy on him), and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

turns it on it's head.  This was another book I started with no expectations,
though unlike &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/brooklyn.html"&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt; I was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't inspiring or
great or anything, nor does it claim to be. It's a very real portrait of
high school, and of someone you know of (but don't really &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt;) dying.
As with any media set in high school your mileage may vary -- no one
has the same experience, and there were definitely a lot of inconsistencies
with my experience of high school. But no matter what your experience was,
it takes you back to the time before adulthood, and the first time you
experienced that confusion and sadness of loss. The main character, Greg,
is a self-depricating, uninspired human in the thick of the teenage years.
He's incredibly well-written, and allows you to forget that he's totally
fiction. It was a great break from
a few more heady books I'm in the middle of, and is a great weekend read
if you're looking for something more seroius than a romance novel but less
serious than LOTR.&lt;/p&gt;

birthday and see &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hippocampusband.com/"&gt;Hippocampus&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mississippistudios.com/"&gt;Mississippi Studios&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="friday"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.werteric.com/"&gt;Eric&lt;/a&gt;, Eli's stepdad drove us from Corvallis to Portland Friday afternoon at
great expense of his time. After ~3 hours in the car we went straight to the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mcmenamins.com/219-bagdad-theater-pub-home"&gt;Baghdad Theater&lt;/a&gt; on Hawthorne to grab dinner and see the new &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3040964/"&gt;Jungle Book&lt;/a&gt;.
It was a solidly C+ movie: visually beautiful, conceptually just like the
original, as an adult not especially satisfying.  But also a good time with
good people, and excellent food (hunger is the best sauce).  After that we went
back to the house to have cake + presents, and DRINK BEER (like one beer each).
Because Eli and I are actually 80 year olds we went to our fancy-schmancy HOTEL
at ~10 and immediately fell asleep.  Typical friday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="saturday"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Saturday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday we woke up late, found breakfast at a non-descript chain (don't judge
us, food in Portland is mad expensive), then wandered over to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.powells.com/"&gt;Powell's&lt;/a&gt;. I
bought a huge bag of cashews and two donuts at Whole Foods which was hands-down
the best purchase I made in all of April, Eli tooled around the book store and
bought a book of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dilbert.com/"&gt;Dilbert&lt;/a&gt; comics, then we decided to go to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://groundkontrol.com/"&gt;Ground Kontrol&lt;/a&gt;.
After $10 of pinball and one totally bullshit round of Tetris, we ran out of
cash money so headed out. With nothing else to do, we decided to take an urban
hike to Eli's parents house, hoping we would arrive around 5pm when we had
agreed to meet them.  This ended up being about 8 miles, which sounds like a
lot but really wasn't that bad. It was also a &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt; day, and we got to
see some cool parts of Portland we don't typically frequent such as the
Tillikum pedestrian bridge and Waterfront.  It also timed out well, as we got
to the house around 16:30 and got to eat + hang out for a bit before heading
out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eli's mom and stepdad are both artists who work from home, and as such are
&lt;em&gt;really cool&lt;/em&gt; and get to rub elbows with a lot of &lt;em&gt;really cool&lt;/em&gt; people.  Like,
it's actually a little intimidatingly cool.  They have a friend who recently
travelled to Paris + Tokyo and spent a few months meeting little-known artists
in those areas through word-of-mouth.  He then compiled his experiences and
interviews with these artists into &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://overcupbooks.com/products/the-tall-trees-of-paris"&gt;a series&lt;/a&gt; and sold it. For money. &lt;em&gt;That's
how cool these people are&lt;/em&gt;.  We talked to him about places we should visit
while in Paris this summer, then got a back-stage tour of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://giganticbrewing.com/"&gt;Gigantic brewery&lt;/a&gt;.
It was very exciting. They print unique art from local artists on each beer
they brew, and we got to see the wall of labels, hear about how they choose the
artist, learn a little about how the brewery started, and see their super
high-tech bottling process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After grabing some brews and buying some souvenirs (a copy of the book and a v
cute hoodie), we headed up to Mississippi st. to have dinner and go to the
concert. Most of the super cute shops Mississippi is know for had closed for
the night by the time we got there, but we were able to dart into a few just
before 7, then found a thai place accross the street from the venue.
Unfortunately the food there was &lt;em&gt;super spicy&lt;/em&gt; and ended up making everyone but
me either cry, or get a little sick.  Keep in mind this is not because I am
impervious to spiciness but because I know I'm weak and ordered the &lt;em&gt;most mild&lt;/em&gt;
dish.  After dinner we went to the venue, got our tickets, and played &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.headsup&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Heads
up&lt;/a&gt; for half an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-show"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Show&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show was excellent! Mississippi is a super cute, cozy, and friendly venue,
and we got a little booze before the show started.  The opener, Riot Lion
Something was surprisingly good -- not only was their music great, but her
voice is &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; live, and they were great performers. It was a totally
unexpected and awesome way to start the evening. Then Hippocampus came on
around 10, and having already done a show earlier that day (like, 3 hours
earlier) they were understandably a little tired.  The band itself is composed
of 4 &lt;em&gt;very attractive&lt;/em&gt; young men, who despite being under 21 had poise, style,
and great stage presence.  Call me biased or shallow, but they were super fun
to watch.  They also interacted with the crowd quite a bit, which I think adds
a lot to a good show, and they played some of their newer stuff as well.  The
show was super short (they only have 2 EPs out, and honestly played everything
I knew of theirs as well as a few new songs, so this wasn't unexpected), and we
caught an 11 pm bus back to downtown Portland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eli was pretty beat by this point, but I was craving something chocolatey so we
decided to hit &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://departureportland.com/"&gt;Departure&lt;/a&gt; before going to bed.  Departures is a fancy
restaurant on the top floor of the Nines hotel, and in the elevator we noticed
a couple that had on shirts that were just Bob Saget's face. Like, not just a
square of his face, like the whole shirt was Bob Saget's face. It was a little
unsettling.  Apparently he had been performing downtown earlier that evening,
and there were just &lt;em&gt;tons&lt;/em&gt; of people from the show going to Departures
afterwards. &amp;quot;So &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is what people do after 10pm&amp;quot; we thought simultaneously.
It's also worth mentioning here that I had never seen Full House and didn't
know who Bob Saget was, let alone recognize him.  We got to our table in the
restaurant, and after ordering Eli told me to look behind me. I did and was
like &amp;quot;Wow, yeah, that is a lot of cleavage&amp;quot; and Eli was like &amp;quot;What? No, Bob
Saget is behind you&amp;quot;. He took a fuzzy, Sasquatch-esque picture, we ate our
brownie + ice cream (the bomb dot com), and headed home to pass out around 1
am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="sunday"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sunday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday morning we woke up late (like, 9am. #students), and went to Fancy Brunch
at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://originaldinerant.com/"&gt;The Original&lt;/a&gt;.  Then we wandered down the waterfront, listened to a few
episodes of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.mythpodcast.com/"&gt;The Myths and Legends Podcast&lt;/a&gt;, then headed to the bus stop. It
was one of those beautiful days where you just do nothing, enjoy the sunshine
and the passers by and good company, the kind of day Sundays are perfect for.
And then, all too soon we were home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall it was a very fun and relaxing trip. It's always nice to get outside
The Cultural Bubble that is University, remember that life isn't all deadlines
and exams, and experience a little art and outdoors.  10/10 would recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

listen to, but to tell you about some lesser-known podcasts that I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gimletmedia.com/show/mystery-show/"&gt;The Mystery Show&lt;/a&gt;. Starlee Kine, who you've definitely
heard on This American Life (?), solves mysteries that can't be solved
online. These aren't the &amp;quot;Who was that guy in that movie?&amp;quot; questions, but
questions like &amp;quot;There's one photo of Britney Spears holding a book that only
sold 100 copies. How did she get a hold of it?&amp;quot; kind of questions. It may
sound like a strange and unlikely premise, but Starlee executes it
&lt;em&gt;perfectly&lt;/em&gt;, and has definitely mastered storytelling.  She's also a
delightful narrator, and her conversations with people are among the most
interesting parts of the show. She's so interested in the lives of the people
she talks to, and even without the mystery part just listening to her
interact with other humans is inspiring.  All in all, one of the best podcast
finds of the last year.  It's still pretty new, so catch up while you can!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gimletmedia.com/show/reply-all"&gt;Reply All&lt;/a&gt;. Hosted by PJ Vogt (pronounced &amp;quot;vote&amp;quot;) and
Alex Goldman, Reply All is a show about the internet.  With top-notch banter
and interesting topics, I've learned a lot from Reply All (mostly about
twitter, but also about who invented email and how terrorists communicate)
and laughed out loud in very public places.  Even if you're not a &amp;quot;techie&amp;quot;
Reply All will probably float your boat.  Try a few episodes, then write me a
thank you note. You're welcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/dopequeens/"&gt;2 Dope Queens&lt;/a&gt;. A new comedy podcast, 2 Dope Queens
is live comedy hosted by Phoebe Robinson and Jessica Williams. It's a nice
break from the more serious podcasts, and as a comedy-world newbie I find
myself laughing out loud multiple times during each episode.  Whether you
already have a favorite comedy podcast or not, I would highly recommend
giving 2DQ a try (obviously, it's on this list).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.mythpodcast.com/"&gt;Myths and Legends&lt;/a&gt;. Hosted by a guy named Jason, the about page
says it best: &amp;quot;This is a weekly podcast telling legendary stories as closely
to the originals as possible. Some are incredibly popular stories you think
you know, but with surprising origins. Others are stories that might be new
to you, but are definitely worth a listen.&amp;quot; Jason weaves in his own analysis
and comments into his unique telling of each story, and the final product is
a highly entertaining, interesting, and educational 30-minute show.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.wbur.org/series/dear-sugar"&gt;Dear Sugar Radio&lt;/a&gt;. DSR is one of my newer finds, and I've fallen in love.
Hosted by Cheryl Strayed and Steve Almond, DSR cover universal topics like
infidelity, lying, and other struggles we all experience by reading and answering
letters from listeners. I grew up listening to Dr. Laura with my mom, and
have seen the light! There is a better way! And this podcast is it. Like,
imagine Dr. Laura hosted by nice and reasonable people instead of mean | crazy |
racist people.  It's honey in my life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://howtodoeverything.org/"&gt;How To Do Everything&lt;/a&gt;. This show is just a way better version of
Stuff You Should Know.  This podcast is the Mecca of banter, the
banter that every duo aspires to, the kind of banter that &lt;em&gt;inspires&lt;/em&gt;.
They also cover all types of questions, calling experts to answer
questions like whether dolphins sleep, if wasps can recognize each other,
and how to do arm-farts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jesslively.com/livelyshow/"&gt;The Jess Lively Show&lt;/a&gt;.  I've already written about this in my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://kexp.org/podcasts"&gt;favorite things post&lt;/a&gt;,
but I'll say it here again: Jess Lively's Show has changed my life!  I move
through the world with so much more intention and purpose, have discovered
values I didn't even know I had, and am generally heartened and inspired by
her and her guests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://kexp.org/podcasts"&gt;KEXP Music That Matters&lt;/a&gt;. Spotify Discovery Weekly not doing it for you?
Each week they put out a curated playlist centered on a theme, and the music
ranges from punk to hard rock to folk to pop to country and beyond.  Some
are great, some aren't, but it's worth wading through the rough stuff
to find the gems. They also tend to focus on artists local to the PNW,
which means it's a great way for me to find shows playing in the area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Podcasts I Listen To That You Probably Do Too:
These are in the order from favorite to least favorite, though if
I didn't like any of them I just wouldn't listen to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/"&gt;This American Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/"&gt;All Songs Considered&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/sections/money/"&gt;Planet Money&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.radiolab.org/"&gt;RadioLab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://loveandradio.org/"&gt;Love + Radio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://freakonomics.com/category/podcasts/"&gt;Freakonomics Radio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

yesterday.  This is my third year and final year organizing the unconference,
and all was strangely calm.  I'm not sure what magical forces to attribute this
to, but usually there is a sharp spike in meetings, tasks, and general PANIC on
the media team starting in mid-January leading up to Barcamp.  Perhaps thanks
to our beautiful + talented writer Amanda, perhaps because our workflow was
&amp;quot;What did we do last year? Yeah, do that&amp;quot;, perhaps because we were old-hat now,
everything seemed to go smoothly and be stress-free. 120 attendees, 32 talks,
too many burgers to count, it was a great time. For me Barcamp is a chance to
see a lot of alumni and old friends that I don't get to see very often, so it
was nice to have a solid chunk of time in the morning to say hello to everyone
and get sufficiently caffeinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="lightning-talks"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lightning Talks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first talk I went to was Lightning Talks, which is a grab-bag of topics in
5-minute installments. As expected some talks were great and some were very
meh, but I definitely learned some new and interesting things about unexpected
topics. The best talk was Eli's on Art History (totally not biased), though one
talk on Explaining Myths in the Theater (ie. &amp;quot;Break a leg&amp;quot;) was also very well
done + interesting, as well as one on how to Correctly have a Polictical
Discussion.  Overall it was a good way to start the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="rust-types-traits"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rust Types + Traits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't gotten on the Rust or Go trains yet, and honestly don't plan to in
the near future, but I do try my best to know what's what with the Hip New
Languages. Though not the best speaker, Mythmon is very knowledgable on the
topic not just of Rust but of language design in general, and the content of
his talk was definitely ideal for my background knowledge.  This was the talk
that I got the most out of at Barcamp, and it helped me be more comfortable
participating in discussions of Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-to-watch-professional-starcraft"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Watch Professional Starcraft&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aspiring video gamer, I was pretty stoked about this talk. I laughed, I
embarrassed myself, I learned a lot about Starcraft. This was a good post-lunch
break from thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="zendo"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Zendo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zendo is an &lt;em&gt;addictive&lt;/em&gt; game. The idea is you have several pyramidal structures
like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="static/zendo.png" style="height: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Master thinks of a simple rule for structures that can be built with the
pyramids. For example, some good rules are &amp;quot;A large piece must touch a small
piece&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;There must be at least six pips in the structure&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;There
must be a blue and white piece in the structure&amp;quot;, etc. Then each player&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely the most entertaining of the &amp;quot;talks&amp;quot;, and it was hard to tear myself
away at 10 to 4pm, when my talk was scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bbq"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BBQ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, we hosted a BBQ at Avery Park after the event.  Good food, good
company, great weather, what more can you ask for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was excellent to see some familiar faces again, and have a day off from
thinking about school.  Since I'm writing this last sentence on September
13th, 5 months after barcamp actually finished, I'm just going to leave it
there and publish this now.  Writing a blog is hard guys.&lt;/p&gt;

it was made into a movie, and had something to do with a
young woman, the early 20th century, and probably
Brooklyn, NY.  Honestly, even that was too much:
I spent much of my time reading it trying to figure out
why someone would choose to turn &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; book into a film
and came away disappointed.  It was blasé, and while I
don't want to diminish the experience of immigrants
to NY in the early 1900s there was nothing unique,
clever, eye-opening, or otherwise remarkable about the novel.
I liked the main character well enough, but found that
in the end I didn't care what happened to her or any of
the other characters. The main character Eilis and her
sister Rose feel very much like female characters written by
a man. You can very clearly see the lens through which
he views them, the brush strokes he uses to create them,
and that makes them seem very unreal.  They feel more
like what you would get if you asked your well-meaning
grandfather to describe his first love interest than
real women, and without the connection to the characters
I found myself struggling to hold on to anything in the
novel.  I appreciate that Tóibín wrote a novel that centered
on strong female characters, and that such a novel
could be turned into an award-winning film. But before
we congratulate ourselves on appreciating a novel about
a woman who travels alone to America, goes to college
and works, and chats with her sister and female roommates,
let's consider that Eilis probably experienced a lot of
fear, racism, sexism, uncertainty, and hardship that
is generally glossed over. Overall I was underwhelmed,
and wouldn't recommend it if you've got other books
on your list to read.&lt;/p&gt;

describing how math is used (and misused) in everyday
life. From the lottery, to elections, to predicting
the weather and the existence of God, Ellenburg
explains how to develop a better intuition for all the number
and percentages swirling around the news and media. It
focuses mostly on statistics, but also delves into
geometry + algebra (and their relationship), multi-dimensional
spaces and linear algebra, and number theory. As a
&amp;quot;relatively mathy&amp;quot; person, I definitely felt like I got a
lot out of it,though I'm not entirely sure I would recommend
it to less mathematically-inclined readers. Although I believe
it was intended for that audience, and is definitely an
accessible view into high mathematics, it's also a book
about math. My point being: don't expect to be spoon fed
math and magically become knowledgable. Like with all knowledge,
you've gotta put in a little work. But it's &lt;em&gt;totally worth it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="some-favorite-quotes"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some favorite quotes:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;And you can't deny that there are aspects of the natural world - I'm
thinking pandas here - that seem more likely to have resulted from grudging
bureaucratic compromise than from the mind of an all knowing deity with
total creative control&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;For those who are willing to adopt a view of probability as degree of belief
Bayes theorem can be seen not as a mere mathematical equation, but as a form
of mathematically flavored advice&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;

author &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Lawson"&gt;Jenny Lawson&lt;/a&gt;, and her struggle with a variety of disorders
including depression and anxiety.  I'm not really sure if it's a
memoir or autobiography or neither, but you can think of it as a
series of blog posts about things that happen in her life, and her
thoughts.  It is &lt;em&gt;hilarious&lt;/em&gt;, and poignant, and helps people who don't
have disorders understand what's it like to have a disorder (I
think....I don't have a disorder, so can't confirm this, but I
definitely &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like I have a better understanding of them now).
She describes what it's like when they get especially bad in very
relatable ways, using experiences that most humans have had, and
without asking for pity.  It's also not just about feels and sad
things -- she narrates her life with silliness and humor, and many of
the experiences themselves are hilarious as well. From waking up to
find her arms are asleep, to having her daughter congratulate her on
making friends, Lawson talks about experiences we've all had without
fear of self-deprecation.  &amp;quot;Furiously Happy&amp;quot; is a fun and
thought-provoking read.  As a side note, I realize this whole post is
very effusive and only has nice things to say about the book. I
honestly have nothing bad to say about it. I expected it to be a quick
and funny read, and got &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more than I bargained for, which is just
about all you can ask of a book. As a sub-side-note, I highly
recommend the audio-book version as well. It's narrated by the author,
has several &amp;quot;extra&amp;quot; little bits in it, and Lawson's narration
definitely adds a lot to the experience of consuming the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-process"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as I recently learned, the interview process for
most tech organizations has three parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="0"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The application. This is like the profile part of
online dating. You submit your resume, the shiniest
version of yourself in the form of paper, but you lie about
knowing Rust instead of liking beer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The HR person. This is usually a 10-15 minute call
with a really nice person
where they ask things like &amp;quot;What are you interested in?&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;When do you graduate?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Are you willing to relocate?&amp;quot;, etc.
They're just trying to ascertain if you're a good fit for the
position you're interviewing for. This is the initial chat
of online dating, but less awkward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The technical interview.  This is 1 or 2 phone calls
with an engineer where they ask you to solve a problem or
two in a shared document. The problems are almost always
related to algorithms, data structures, or networking.
Seriously, know your networks man.  This is the first/second
date stage of the interview, where you try to decide if
this is even someone you want to get involved with and if
there's any possibility for romance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The on site. If your technical interviews go well and
you seem like a good fit, you'll have an on site interview.
This is like 1-2 years of dating in 5 hours.  This is where the company
flies you down to their
location and interviews you for 5-6 hours in 45-60 minute
chunks, usually with 1-2 engineers per interview.  Yes, they
are exhausting, no matter how many times people ask if you
need water or coffee. It also gives you an appreciation for
how arduous transporting humans from point A to point B is.
This is their (and your) last chance to see if you're ready
to commit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the onsite, you're just waiting to hear back. Usually it takes between
a week and a month, but if you haven't heard anything in 1.5 to 2 weeks it's
appropriate to contact the recruiter you've been talking to and ask when
you should expect to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-companies"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Companies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="apple"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Apple&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I interviewed with Apple on a Monday in early January.  You know
those industrial parks you go to when your Comcast shit isn't working,
where they have miles of rectangular concrete buildings where souls go to die?
That's what Apple HQ looks like.  I know, I know, they're building a new
campus that's going to be the bestest tech campus in The World and Mars, but
for now it's pretty subpar.  There's nothing to see or do in Cupertino, so
when I got there an hour early I ended up just going to Safeway and getting
mouth wash.  After checking in and hanging out for a while, the marathon began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up having 6 45-minute interviews with a lunch break after Round 2.
Each interview was with two engineers from the team I was applying to be on,
and overall I thought I showed as well as I could have.  There were some
engineers I instantly clicked with and really liked, and others that were
much less inviting, but on the whole it was as pleasant as 7 hours of
interviewing can be.  More often than not the interviewing wrapped up
early, and in asking their engineers about how they liked Apple it
was clear that every engineer there drank the Apple kool-aid. Maybe this
seems obvious since they work there, but interviewing at Apple made me
realize how important Open Source Software is to me.  I thought it was
something I could take or leave, but sentences like &amp;quot;I enjoy the big
reveals, a lot of times I have no idea what the final product will
look like as we're working on it&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I can't talk to my neighbor
about what I'm doing&amp;quot; gave me literal chills.  It's definitely for
some people, just not me. There were also startingly few women at
Apple, particularly in engineering roles, which was another big red
flag for me.  This isn't to say Apple's a bad place or company, just
that it wasn't the right fit for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="google"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Google&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google (Mountianview) had a &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt; campus. I got there ~2 hours early, and spent the whole
time exploring sites like the Android Garden, little google shops, and generally
wandering around. It's like it's own small, clean city with beautiful landscapes,
an amphitheater, movies, shops, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/android-garden.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I was in the right place, the interviewing
began right away.  As I said, I won't discuss the details of questions asked, but
the google interview questions were very fun to consider, reason about, and optimize.
I found myself thinking about the questions over the next few days and trying to
improve my answers, and at the end of the day found that I was energized rather than
exhausted by the problems put before me.  You can find some &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.impactinterview.com/2009/10/140-google-interview-questions/"&gt;retired google interview
questions&lt;/a&gt; online, but I will say that in my experience they're unlike questions
asked by any other company.  Use for fun or brain work, not general interview practice.
The engineers were all very nice and interesting, and it was clear that each was
passionate about technology and working at Google (of course).  Though this was
exciting as a soon-to-be graduate, it also hinted at how each persons &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt;
was Google, and seemed that culturally it would be very hard to have kids or
real hobbies outside of work.  I know this is something they are working on, and
can't confirm that this is culturally true, it was just the vibe I got during
my very short time there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/expectant-mother.jpg" style="height: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This onsite consisted of 4 hour-long interviews with a lunch break, each
interview being one-on-one, which I found much more manageable than two-on-one.
The interviews were very directed and structured, which I really liked, and left
plenty of time for me to ask questions of my interviewers.  It's also worth
mentioning that my interviewers were diverse in terms of race, gender, and age,
which was refreshing. Once I had finished, I was on my way!  Google has a very
nifty interview process, whereby a committee reviews your interview
based on notes the interviewers take in order to minimize any biases the
interviewers may have. The committee then determines whether to hire you or
not, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; once you're hired they place you in a department or project you're
interested in. So you don't interview for a particular position, and you're
not competing with other brains for the same job: it's just a matter of
whether you're up to snuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I had a really good time interviewing for Google, and despite
not getting the job consider it a great experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="linux-foundation"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Linux Foundation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't get as far into the LF interview process, but want to write
about it because their code challenge &lt;em&gt;consumed&lt;/em&gt; my life for a solid
week. This is mostly my own fault: the challenge was to create a
site using Drupal, which I have ample experience doing, and so
as a challenge I chose to use Drupal 8 instead of 7.  Never. Again.
Drupal 8 has some great and cool features, namely better templating.
But it's not well documented, not widely used, and is &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt;
different from Drupal 7. I was in way over my head, and honestly
spent probably close to 50 hours on a project that was supposed
to take 8.  I'm sure some LF folks will read this and chuckle,
but it was an emotional technical journey that I'm glad I took.
As arduous as it was, it feels strangely pleasurable to get sucked
into a project like that, and I learned a whole lot about Drupal.
This doesn't really reflect LF at all, but I guess can be
taken as a lesson regarding how great interviews can be regardless
of whether you get the job?  Or something.  I just thought you
all should know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="puppet"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Puppet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't go on about how much I enjoyed
interviewing at Puppet. I interned there the previous summer, so
much of that enjoyment was in seeing old friends and getting
lots of hugs. I also know that raving about stuff sounds
cheesy and fake like squeezy cheese, and this blog post is
not about squeezy cheese. Barf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puppet's interview was 6 45-minute interviews, each with 2
engineers from the team I would be working on, and including
a one-on-one lunch.  The interviews were pretty standard stuff
(tell us about yourself, answer technical questions, etc.), but
in interviewing my interviewers it was clear that Puppet
prioritized &lt;em&gt;having a life&lt;/em&gt; outside of work. Most people had
kids, and everyone had a variety of hobbies as well, from
motorcycling to painting to construction and so on.  I know
work-life balance isn't a key word for everyone, but
for me personally it was a huge relief to know that I wouldn't be
expected to work 60-80 hours/week and could pursue other
interests after hours.  Puppet 100%
won on diversity as well, with a wide variety of races, ages,
and gender non-binary interviewers.  All in all, it was
a really fun day, and cemented for me that Puppet was
the right place for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll emphasize again that I'm very biased, particularly since
I accepted the job at Puppet and had worked there previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started looking for a job in mid-November and accepted the
position at Puppet mid-March. Finding a job is &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;, even
as a fully-qualified, young, white woman with years of
previous work experience.  Not only is it hard to get an offer,
but it's hard to research companies you're interested in, optimize
your resume, apply, hope, schedule calls, take time between
classes talking to recruiters and engineers for hourse, fly or drive
offsite for a full day of interviews, hear &amp;quot;We're sorry but...&amp;quot; over
and over and over. I have to admit that I was expecting the
interview process to take time, but underestimated how much energy
and emotion and effort it would take.  I've learned a lot about
the job market, about what I value and need in a career, and
about where I stand in comparison with my peers. But I'm
also thrilled with where I landed, and could not be
more excited to start working at Puppet this summer. I
wish anyone reading this before job searching good luck,
and hope that your experiences are enlightening if not
fruitful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, remember:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don't get a position, it's not &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; fault.
I interview candidates for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://osuosl.org"&gt;OSU Open Source Lab&lt;/a&gt;
and most of the time a candidate is well-suited to the
position, but there's just someone else we think would be
a little bit better.  It's not personal, it's not mean,
it's not that you're not good enough. It's not &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think about your values, and whether a company aligns with
them. It's so tempting to just go for prestige: Google, Apple,
Intel, etc. But if you're not crazy about how that company
operates, or what it makes, you don't want to spend years
working there.  Do your research, and &lt;em&gt;know what you want&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies want the same thing you do: for this to be a good
fit! If they don't think it is, then maybe they're right:
maybe it's not the right place for you.  Find a company
that's stoked to bring you on board!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;picture of me w/ phone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so many applications out there, it's difficult to discern which are
valuable, usable, and do what you expect them to.  So, for the sake
of those like me, here are some of the applications I have found
particularly useful or entertaining. I should also mention that these are
all free and available on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://multco.lib.overdrive.com"&gt;Overdrive&lt;/a&gt;: You can connect overdrive to local libraries and checkout
books to read or listen to on mobile. I use it to download and listen to
audiobooks, and honestly went from reading 0 books/year to about 1/week.
It's completely changed my life, and made the mundane moments like doing
laundry or walking to class more entertaining.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.danoeh.antennapod&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;AntennaPod&lt;/a&gt;: Similar to Overdrive, this app brings you great listening
material in a different form: podcasts.  It has lots of fancy features now
like adjustable playback speed, automatic deletion once you've listened
to an episode, and turning off if you fall asleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=another.music.player&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Shuttle&lt;/a&gt;: This is just a music player I'm happy with. If you're happy
with your music player, I wouldn't worry about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.acorns.android&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Acorns&lt;/a&gt;: The idea here is that it rounds up any debit/credit card purchases
you make to the next dollar, invests the money, and then you have access
to it whenver you need it, and it can continue to grow if you don't.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bandsintown&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Bandsintown&lt;/a&gt;: You've probably heard of this one, but if not, it's a great
way to find shows in your city.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.headsup&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Heads up&lt;/a&gt;: This a fun &amp;quot;We're waiting for something and need to pass
the time&amp;quot; app. It's especially great with kids.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mint&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Mint&lt;/a&gt;: I use this mostly to set and maintain budgets. You need to give it
some very personal banking information, so if you're not into that this isn't
for you, but if you are I've found it very useful. You can even see your
credit score on it, which is always good to know!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.duolingo.com/"&gt;Duolingo&lt;/a&gt;: You've more than likely already heard of this, but if not
it's an addictive, gamified way of learning new languages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.onetoday&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;One Today&lt;/a&gt;: A super easy way to make donations to charities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

We all do. The series has become an empire, with it's own movie series
and theme park, and no matter what subset of Harry Potter related
media you've experienced you have some thoughts about it. Regardless
of what those notions are -- good, bad, or ugly -- read on!  I have
had my own preconceptions about HP at various points in my life, and
after re-reading all seven books right in a row I can tell you that
many of them were turned upside down.  It may not be the series for
you, but before you go invest time in reading it, you may as well read
this way shorter blog post about it so you know what you're getting
into at least a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="preconceptions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Preconceptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many twenty-somethings, Harry Potter was the series of my
adolescence, and I grew up with Harry, Ron, and Hermione. I stood in
line for six hours to get the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th books, dressed as
a wizard and talking to other HP fans. I went to the midnight premier
of at least three of the movies.  I wasn't the most into it of all my
friends, but I drank the Kool-Aid. However, as I picked up the first
book again a few months ago I wasn't expecting Harry Potter to be a
great series.  I expected that they would be perfectly adequate tween
novels that I had loved in my youth but now, older and wiser, would
realize I had outgrown, like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Jackson_%26_the_Olympians"&gt;Percy Jackson&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.neopets.com"&gt;Neopets&lt;/a&gt;.  I'll get
to the chase you know is coming, reader: Harry Potter is not just a
kids book.  The characters are what make these books extraordinary, as
they are all layered, multidimensional, &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; people who reflect
modern society so well.  JK Rowling is able to capture the many ways
we judge other humans in her characters, and the lengths we'll go to
defend those judgements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-series"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Series&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the series is seven novels long, in reality it's one story
spanning seven years, that you do have to read in order and all of.
This isn't &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Ark"&gt;Animal Ark&lt;/a&gt; people.  There's no picking one book and
saying &amp;quot;Read this and you've read them all&amp;quot;.  That said, &lt;em&gt;it's 100%
worth it&lt;/em&gt;.  And I will say, some of the books are better than others.
My personal favorite was &amp;quot;The Half-Blood Prince&amp;quot;, but there is no
weak-link in the set, or book I finished and thought &amp;quot;Man, I really
hope the next one is better&amp;quot;. &lt;strong&gt;TL;DR Yes you have to read them all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-i-loved"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I loved&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Characters&lt;/strong&gt;. Growing up, all I remember is hating Snape. I had
no recollection of what an incredible character he is, so painfully
human and deeply entangled in the story.  The Malfoys, the Weasleys,
each delicately balanced between family and principles, conflicted
in how to choose what's best for those they love. So. Good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The HP Universe&lt;/strong&gt;.  JK Rowlings universe is very well thought out,
with details like government policy, racial prejudices, and even
the &lt;em&gt;botany&lt;/em&gt; of the universe created from scratch and implemented
perfectly.  Percy stresses about regulating cauldron-bottoms to be
thick enough. Neville knows the properties of Gillyweed and Devil's Snare.
History class is boring, standardized tests are stressful, and
non-wizards, muggle-born wizards, and women are all placed in a
social hierarchy similar to the racial strata that exists today.
The detail and consistency here is incredible, and makes the magical
world of Harry Potter that much more immersive and &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Form&lt;/strong&gt;.  Did you ever notice that there are no swear words in
Harry Potter?  And no modern technology more recent than a telephone or
TV, despite that these were written as iphones and laptops were
being developed and changing the world. It's executed so well that
you don't even notice.  There are prominent and powerful women,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Themes&lt;/strong&gt;. Rowling uses Harry Potter to explore coming of age,
racism and the hatred that arises from misunderstanding, corrupt
politics, greed, the psychology of abusive relationships, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's timeless&lt;/strong&gt;.  My second time through I feel as though I've barely scratched the
surface of deriving meaning from this series, and the layers of
complexity make this an excellent book for readers of all ages
and stages of life. I love that the series grows with you, taking
on new meaning each time it's revisited, and it makes me so excited
to read the series again in the future and see how it changes.  The
technology (or lack thereof) also adds to this timelessness, and
even a hundred years from now the books will still be just as relevant
and relatable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've made it this far: you know how I feel.  If you have any
questions, comments, or concerns, please email me at
wyman[dot]lucy[at]gmail[dot]com, and we can RAVE about how great HP is
together. In the meantime, have an excellent day, you lovely human
you.&lt;/p&gt;

them better than others.  I decided to get one because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I didn't want to be scared of permanently changing my body.&lt;/strong&gt;  We
make decisions that permanently alter the course of our life pretty
often, in much bigger ways than a tattoo will, and I know I will
regret coming to the end of my life with no permanent marks.  I
have scars and birthmarks, it seemed it was time to make a mark
that I got to dictate, that represented some aspect of myself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's a profoundly human experience&lt;/strong&gt;, and in general I like to
experience things other humans have in order to feel as though I've
lived my life to its fullest.  There are obvious lines I don't
cross (ie. heroin), but even the process of deciding on a design
and getting it has taught me a lot.  If you don't believe me, try
it out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wanted to think long and hard about my life up to this point,
and find the parts that mattered the most.&lt;/strong&gt;  Of course, there's no
need to get a tattoo in order to do this.  However, I'm about to
graduate from college and begin The Rest Of My Life,  and for me
personally a tattoo seems as good a way as any to mark this turning
point in my life and attempt to encapsulate the last 21 years into
something permanent that I can carry with me going forward. This
isn't to say that I can be boiled down into a single image or
phrase and have that put on my body, but it is to say that there
are some key points to represent symbolically that can help
solidify my identity at this point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They can be beautiful, and start conversations.&lt;/strong&gt; Nuff said.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with these intentions in mind, I set about getting a tattoo. In
some ways it was much easier than expected, in that there is a local
tattoo parlor that does high-quality work and is very safe. But on the
whole it wasn't exactly easy, as permanently changing your body using
needles probably shouldn't be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="choosing-a-design"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Choosing a Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted the tattoo to be small, simple, and something I knew I wasn't
likely to regret.  It needed to represent some part of myself that
wasn't liable to change, and that I wouldn't be embarrassed to talk
about.  With this criteria in mind I had a few ideas of things that my
tattoo could be &amp;quot;about&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portland, OR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something very generic + symbolic (ie. an equals sign)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was wary of quotes, as they seemed less pliable in their meaning,
and seemed more likely to &amp;quot;tire out&amp;quot; so to speak.  Besides, if I
really liked a quote, I had plenty of skin to get other tattoos in the
future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researching designs brought up a few contenders:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-left"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/equal-tattoo.jpg" style="width: 30%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/sun-watercolor.jpg" style="width: 30%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/rose-tattoo.jpg" style="width: 30%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After consulting friends and learning more about what kinds of tattoos
are difficult to execute, and which aren't, I settled on this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/my-tattoo.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the portland, in plain black ink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go small at first! You have plenty of space to get bigger ones later,
and you'll know what you're getting yourself into.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get line art.  This limits what you can get quite a bit, but again
line art is so much easier to get, and you'll almost definitely be happier
with the finally product. You can always work your way up to large, colored
tats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go with as few colors as possible.  Colors just add time, complexity,
and money to the tattoo.  It doesn't have to be black and white, but
if you can turn your design into black and white and still love it,
it's much easier!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="getting-the-tattoo"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting the Tattoo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually getting my tattoo was easy and relatively painless. I had a
super brief consultation with the local parlor to get some questions
answered and show them my design, then made an appointment for a few
days later.  The only advice I received about prepping for getting the
tattoo was pretty solid life advice: drink lots of water, eat a good
healthy meal before, get enough sleep.  Standard stuff. I got to my
appointment &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; early (like, half an hour early) because I was so
nervous, and spent the time filling out some paperwork and pacing.  My
boyfriend came with me, which was very helpful. It was great not just
to have support there, but someone to talk to and experience this
with.  I said it was fine if he didn't come, but in retrospect I would
not want to get a tattoo alone. So, around 7 the tattoo artist set up
the table, showed me her rendering of the design, and then did this
cool paper-to-skin thing so you could basically see how the tattoo was
going to look before getting inked.  It looked great, so we got
started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My tattoo is on my ribs, which regular tattoo-getters will tell you is
among the more painful spots since it's so close to bone.  It
definitely wasn't comfortable, but my tattoo was so small and simple
that it wasn't painful so much as annoying. It feels like someone is
rubbing the tip of a needle on your skin, not like it's &lt;em&gt;cutting&lt;/em&gt; you,
but just lightly scratch.  If you have a really sharp pencil, you can
try drawing on your skin, and that's about how it feels.  My tattoo
took about 10 minutes from start to finish, and with my beau to keep
me distracted it went by pretty quick.  My tattoo artist was also
incredibly sweet, understanding, and supportive, and made the whole
experience that much more pleasant. Once it was done, I took a look to
make sure it all looked good.  I won't get too cheesy, but it was love
at first sight. As anyone is with their first tattoo, I was nervous
that I would regret getting something put permanently on my body, but
I knew when I saw it that I had made the right decision. Crisis:
avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/my-tat-picture.jpeg" style="width: 40%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="post-tattoo"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Post-tattoo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super cool tattoo lady hooked me up with some tattoo-care products for
totally reasonable and worth-it prices, including a nice soap and
lotion.  Since my tattoo was so small and minimal it never hurt,
turned red, itched, or any of the other possible skin irritation that
often come after getting a tattoo.  I even forgot I had one the next
day, and as I was getting ready for bed thought &amp;quot;OH MY GOD WHAT
HAPPENED oh right I got a tattoo&amp;quot;.  The lesson: start small!  It's
been 100% painless as long as you take good care of it.  It's been
exactly 1 week since I got it as of this writing, and by now it feels
like a completely normal and natural part of my body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I'm very happy with my tattoo, and the decision to get it.
There are totally unexpected side effects of empowerment, and my
tattoo is not just a reminder of where I come from but that my body is
&lt;em&gt;mine&lt;/em&gt;, and that I get to choose what happens to it. I have to admit
that my parents explicitly didn't approve of my getting one, and I was
really hurt that they wouldn't support me.  I understand that as
parents their job is to keep me safe and avoid regrettable decisions,
which a tattoo very well could be. But (as is hopefully evidenced by
this post!) I put a lot of thought and care into getting one, and wish
that they had been more understanding.  Luckily, it's not very
visible, so no one &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to know.  Even if they do find out (probably
through this post), it's my body! Yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm thrilled that I can carry a piece of my childhood with me into
adulthood now, and know what it's like to be tattooed.  It's almost
like being part of a club, and has already sparked some very
interesting and intimate conversations with co-workers and friends
about their tattoos, and how they decided to get them.  I'm not sure
what the best way to end this post is, but I hope it's been helpful |
insightful | interesting! Have an excellent day :)&lt;/p&gt;

generally Having a Great Mom, or something, I wanted to give my mom a
shoutout for teaching me that happy + healthy &amp;gt; skinny.  My mom works &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;
for her body, doing an hour-long cardio and strength class (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.jazzercise.com/"&gt;Jazzercise&lt;/a&gt;)
at least 5 days a week.  For more than 30 years. And it shows -- she has
great blood pressure, a healthy heart rate, and can walk way farther and longer
than my brother or I (seriously, bring comfortable walking shoes if you
ever go on vacation with us. Lessons learned the hard way.).  In fact,
a few years ago my mom had her gallbladder removed, came home and
cooked dinner &lt;em&gt;that night&lt;/em&gt;. If that's not strong and healthy, call me
a monkey's uncle.  She also eats what she wants, when she wants, to
help her body feel good.  From not having a scale in the house, to
prioritizing intellect and personality over looks, to
emphasizing exercise and good food, my mom built an ideal body-image
foundation.  This isn't to say I've always had a healthy
relationship with food, but it's been easy to develop one.  I'm
so grateful to my mom for helping me see that your waistline
doesn't indicate how healthy you are, that big hispanic booties
are a great ass-et, and that exercising and eating to feel good
will make me way happeir (and healthier) than dieting ever will.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a living list of media that has significantly
changed my life in some way. Whether clarifying values I held, inspiring
me to change my thoughts or actions, or teaching me , the experiences below

never fail to pull me out of a bad mood, and especially in an industry
so dominated by men hearing from working women is incredibly inspiring
and uplifting.  From &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jesslively.com/carolinerector/"&gt;capsule wardrobes&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jesslively.com/decemberfavorites2015/"&gt;focusing on pleasure&lt;/a&gt; to

this highly anticipated read, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Hunger-Makes-Me-Modern-Girl/dp/1594486638"&gt;Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl&lt;/a&gt; by
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.carriebrownstein.com/"&gt;Carrie Brownstein&lt;/a&gt;. Brownstein's memoir of her
time in the band &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sleater-kinney.com/"&gt;Sleater-Kinney&lt;/a&gt;, this book was raw to the point
of discomfort. Whatever opinions I may have, they're outweighed
by the respect I have for Brownstein's openness, vulnerability, and honesty.
The whole book, beginning to end, is one long intimate passage into
the private lives of herself, her family, and her bandmates, sharing
details I would cringe to tell my own friends, let alone publish
for the world to read. More than anything I'm in awe of her
talent for writing and fearless storytelling.  After the
amazement at her baring-all, though, I had a few other thoughts
on the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went in with few expectations and
scattered knowledge of Carrie Brownstein. I knew from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/"&gt;All Songs Considered&lt;/a&gt;
that she was a member of Sleater-Kinney, that she had worked briefly
for that podcast, and of course knew about her role in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ifc.com/shows/portlandia"&gt;Portlandia&lt;/a&gt;.
But I had never listened to Sleater-Kinney's music, much less studied their
past or had any part in the Pacific Northwest punk scene. In hindsight,
doing a little bit of studying before hand would have been helpful --
the book catalogs her experiences before, during, and briefly after
Sleater-Kinney exclusively, and she frequently references bands and
events I had never heard of, despite being so geographically and
temporally close to them.  This was a bug and a feature: knowing so
little made the book more educational, interesting, and worthwhile,
but also in many ways less meaningful or impactful for me personally.
That said, Brownstein includes so much more than just a history of
the band.  Her struggles with anxiety and depression, a variety
of physical conditions including shingles and an allergy to soy,
and hypochondria while touring with a band, are very much relatable
to any who has battled those same battles. She also speaks at length
of coming of age and finding what she wanted to do, of how her parents
own repressed selves affected her childhood, and of other
profound thoughts on the human experience in the modern age, and how
to navigate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, &amp;quot;Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl&amp;quot; was an enjoyable
and worthwhile read. Entertaining, insightful, and almost unbearably
honest, I would highly recommend picking this up if you have a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

homework, I plan to start reviewing the books I read (or, rather,
listen to).  I'm currently making my way through the Harry Potter
series again, but in the meantime got a chance to read &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Ready-Player-One-A-Novel/dp/0307887448"&gt;Ready Player
One by Ernest Cline&lt;/a&gt;.  Set 30 years in the future, Ready Player One
depicts a bleak distopia where a MMORPG (massively multiplayer online
role playing game) called the OASIS is the only escape from reality,
and has in fact replaced it.  The novel follows teenager Wade Watts
through a Hunger Games-esque competition requiring expansive and
detailed knowledge of 80's tech culture, from video games to movies to
comic books and beyond.  This is a total candy read, and if you're
into science fiction or Neal Stephenson novels (particularly
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Reamde-A-Novel-Neal-Stephenson/dp/0062191497"&gt;Reamde&lt;/a&gt;), this would definitely be a good weekend pick-me-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, it didn't hit my literary sweet spot, but then again I
can't say I expected it to. I will say it was much more accessible
than I expected it to be, and aligned perfectly with my values:
intellect winning out over money; strong, rich, diverse characters;
well researched but not obscure.  Candy Read.  Without giving too much
away (fear not, read on), what made it most enjoyable was the very
distinct Good vs. Evil dynamic, and how each party was very clearly on
one side or the other. It was easy to root for the the protagonists,
against the antagonists, and just be along for the plot-ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's all she wrote.  My next review will be sometime next week
on Carrie Brownstein's memoir &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Hunger-Makes-Me-Modern-Girl/dp/1594486638"&gt;Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="day-0"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 0:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pulled up to the venue at about 5:30 Friday night, T-90 minutes to Ignite
talks.  I chugged a chocolate milk from the &amp;quot;gift store&amp;quot;, ran through my
slides one last time, got dinner with the bosses, and found myself on a stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-ignite-talks"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Ignite Talks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deb Nicholson, &lt;strong&gt;The Foss Awakens&lt;/strong&gt;. How collaboration and mentoring
are a force for good, told with Star Wars images. Grade-A speaker, definitely
delivered. Great way to start the evening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gilbert Standen, &lt;strong&gt;Building Oracle on LXC&lt;/strong&gt;. He lost me at &amp;quot;Oracle&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Me. &lt;strong&gt;Rocking the House&lt;/strong&gt;.  But seriously, people laughed at my jokes,
I got high-fived, it went better than expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dave Nielsen, &lt;strong&gt;Redis&lt;/strong&gt;. Kind of informative, kind of boring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emily Dunham, &lt;strong&gt;Where's the Cloud&lt;/strong&gt;. Much like Deb, Emily is a veteran
speaker and it shows. Funny, informative, ended on a pun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don Marti, &lt;strong&gt;Web ads&lt;/strong&gt;. I would have appreciated it more if I was less sleepy
I think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Justin King, &lt;strong&gt;Choosing a Framework for your project&lt;/strong&gt;. Knowledgable and
well spoken, it's pretty great to watch a not-adult give a talk.  They have
great perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corey Quinn: &lt;strong&gt;Docker Must Die: Heresy in the Church of Docker&lt;/strong&gt;. So, so
funny. Dude is a master.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some good laughs, I headed back up to my room, realized how
overwhelmingly underprepared I was for my talk, finished up my slides and hit
the hay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="day-1"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 1:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woke up early and got breakfast at this adorable bakery, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/euro-pane-bakery-pasadena"&gt;Euro Pane&lt;/a&gt;.
Ran through the talk once for good measure, then headed over to the Key Note,
by Mark Shuttleworth. Honestly, it was pretty much a sales pitch, and I
wasn't really into it. But at least I didn't feel bad leaving early. I headed
over to my room, set everything up, then walked around to get out the nerves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="my-talk"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My Talk&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://slides.lucywyman.me/modifying-the-kernel.html"&gt;Modifying the Kernel: A How-to&lt;/a&gt;
Not my best, not my worst. I got across the information I wanted to, and got
lots of positive feedback after the talk and throughout the day. More than
anything, I'm relieved that it's over and I can cross it off of my
to-do list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="lunch"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lunch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had guacamole, made tableside. It was &lt;em&gt;bomb&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="keila-banks-automated-teen"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keila Banks, Automated Teen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was really excited for this talk, and was a little let down. Between mic
issues, some nerves, and being a little out of touch with the conference,
I didn't get what I wanted to out of the talk.  All of that said, I have a
lot of respect for Keila giving a talk to such a big room, and for getting up
there in the first place. I'm excited to see what she does in the future, and
hope to see her at other Open Source conferences soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="justin-mayer-essential-linux-security"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Justin Mayer, Essential Linux Security&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was pretty nearly the perfect talk.  I learned about a lot of valuable
tools, including changes you can make to your SSH configs, creating SSL
certificates with Let's Encrypt, HSTS, CSP, and other tools to make my
computer and websites safer.  In Justin's words, &amp;quot;Think of the children&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check out his slides at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://justinmayer.com/talks/server-security/#/"&gt;https://justinmayer.com/talks/server-security/#/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="brandon-philips-etcd"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Brandon Philips, Etcd&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also a great talk. Brandon is obviously a well-practiced speaker who
seemed very comfortable on stage.  He's also incredibly knowledgeable, and it
was clear that this talk was only skimming the surface of what he knows on
the subject of etcd. I also didn't know very much about etcd or CoreOS going
in to the talk -- I even thought the d was for daemon :p -- so stood to get
a lot out of it. And I did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see some of the demos he did at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/philips/hacks/tree/master/etcd-demos"&gt;https://github.com/philips/hacks/tree/master/etcd-demos&lt;/a&gt;,
or learn more about CoreOS at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://coreos.com/"&gt;https://coreos.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="day-2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 2:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning was absolutely &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt; in Pasadena.  I got to walk around
for a while before everyone else woke up, and soak in some Sunday Morning
magic. I don't know. There's something about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="keynote-sarah-sharp-on-diversity"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keynote: Sarah Sharp on Diversity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said a lot of really important things, but they're also things that everyone
has heard before.  She knows her stuff, and seems very passionate, but that
keynote isn't going to change anything.  Call me a cynic, but from the two
guys behind me asking &amp;quot;Why should minorities get a stipend just for getting an
internship?&amp;quot; to ethnic homogeneity of the audience, I don't hold much hope
for tech companies realizing how important diversity of their workforce is
any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="randal-schwartz-intro-to-dart"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Randal Schwartz, Intro to Dart&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I spent this whole talk just working on making this blog. Woops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="other-things-i-saw-today"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other Things I Saw Today&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two pugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three grown men yell group hug and execute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the rest of the day doing homework and travelling. It's amazing how
much effort it takes to move a human from A to B, and I have to say I was
so exhausted by the time we got to Corvallis around 12:30.  Lesson learned:
I am not a Sunday-worker. Sundays are for blankets and tea and tv, not
late night flights and talking to other humans.  Overall, SCaLE was
less stressful than I thought it would be, and I don't regret going
like I thought I would. Maybe that sounds lukewarm, and I have to say
it is a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; well run conference, and my particular sentiments don't
reflect a lack of effort on the part of the organizers,
presenters, or exhibitors. Objectively, it's a great conference.  I'm
not really sure how to end this post. I might think of something
better later. For now, ciao gentle reader. You excellent human you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
