You put on your nice clothes. You're
kind of nervous at first. &amp;quot;Will they like me?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Am I smiling too much?&amp;quot;,

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, it's difficult to stand in judgement of other humans,
particularly with your career on the line!
So, in an effort to remember and transfer the memories of interviewing, I'm
recording my experiences with a variety of organizations here for posterity
(read: Future Lucy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: I won't be discussing
any details of questions asked during the interviews, and
will omit the names of anyone who interviewed me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-process"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as I recently learned, the interview process for
most tech organizations has three parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="0"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The application. This is like the profile part of
online dating. You submit your resume, the shiniest
version of yourself in the form of paper, but you lie about
knowing Rust instead of liking beer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The HR person. This is usually a 10-15 minute call
with a really nice person
where they ask things like &amp;quot;What are you interested in?&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;When do you graduate?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Are you willing to relocate?&amp;quot;, etc.
They're just trying to ascertain if you're a good fit for the
position you're interviewing for. This is the initial chat
of online dating, but less awkward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The technical interview.  This is 1 or 2 phone calls
with an engineer where they ask you to solve a problem or
two in a shared document. The problems are almost always
related to algorithms, data structures, or networking.
Seriously, know your networks man.  This is the first/second
date stage of the interview, where you try to decide if
this is even someone you want to get involved with and if
there's any possibility for romance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The on site. If your technical interviews go well and
you seem like a good fit, you'll have an on site interview.
This is like 1-2 years of dating in 5 hours.  This is where the company
flies you down to their
location and interviews you for 5-6 hours in 45-60 minute
chunks, usually with 1-2 engineers per interview.  Yes, they
are exhausting, no matter how many times people ask if you
need water or coffee. It also gives you an appreciation for
how arduous transporting humans from point A to point B is.
This is their (and your) last chance to see if you're ready
to commit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the onsite, you're just waiting to hear back. Usually it takes between
a week and a month, but if you haven't heard anything in 1.5 to 2 weeks it's
appropriate to contact the recruiter you've been talking to and ask when
you should expect to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-companies"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Companies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="apple"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Apple&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I interviewed with Apple on a Monday in early January.  You know
those industrial parks you go to when your Comcast shit isn't working,
where they have miles of rectangular concrete buildings where souls go to die?
That's what Apple HQ looks like.  I know, I know, they're building a new
campus that's going to be the bestest tech campus in The World and Mars, but
for now it's pretty subpar.  There's nothing to see or do in Cupertino, so
when I got there an hour early I ended up just going to Safeway and getting
mouth wash.  After checking in and hanging out for a while, the marathon began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up having 6 45-minute interviews with a lunch break after Round 2.
Each interview was with two engineers from the team I was applying to be on,
and overall I thought I showed as well as I could have.  There were some
engineers I instantly clicked with and really liked, and others that were
much less inviting, but on the whole it was as pleasant as 7 hours of
interviewing can be.  More often than not the interviewing wrapped up
early, and in asking their engineers about how they liked Apple it
was clear that every engineer there drank the Apple kool-aid. Maybe this
seems obvious since they work there, but interviewing at Apple made me
realize how important Open Source Software is to me.  I thought it was
something I could take or leave, but sentences like &amp;quot;I enjoy the big
reveals, a lot of times I have no idea what the final product will
look like as we're working on it&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I can't talk to my neighbor
about what I'm doing&amp;quot; gave me literal chills.  It's definitely for
some people, just not me. There were also startingly few women at
Apple, particularly in engineering roles, which was another big red
flag for me.  This isn't to say Apple's a bad place or company, just
that it wasn't the right fit for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="google"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Google&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google (Mountianview) had a &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt; campus. I got there ~2 hours early, and spent the whole
time exploring sites like the Android Garden, little google shops, and generally
wandering around. It's like it's own small, clean city with beautiful landscapes,
an amphitheater, movies, shops, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/android-garden.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I was in the right place, the interviewing
began right away.  As I said, I won't discuss the details of questions asked, but
the google interview questions were very fun to consider, reason about, and optimize.
I found myself thinking about the questions over the next few days and trying to
improve my answers, and at the end of the day found that I was energized rather than
exhausted by the problems put before me.  You can find some &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.impactinterview.com/2009/10/140-google-interview-questions/"&gt;retired google interview
questions&lt;/a&gt; online, but I will say that in my experience they're unlike questions
asked by any other company.  Use for fun or brain work, not general interview practice.
The engineers were all very nice and interesting, and it was clear that each was
passionate about technology and working at Google (of course).  Though this was
exciting as a soon-to-be graduate, it also hinted at how each persons &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt;
was Google, and seemed that culturally it would be very hard to have kids or
real hobbies outside of work.  I know this is something they are working on, and
can't confirm that this is culturally true, it was just the vibe I got during
my very short time there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/expectant-mother.jpg" style="height: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This onsite consisted of 4 hour-long interviews with a lunch break, each
interview being one-on-one, which I found much more manageable than two-on-one.
The interviews were very directed and structured, which I really liked, and left
plenty of time for me to ask questions of my interviewers.  It's also worth
mentioning that my interviewers were diverse in terms of race, gender, and age,
which was refreshing. Once I had finished, I was on my way!  Google has a very
nifty interview process, whereby a committee reviews your interview
based on notes the interviewers take in order to minimize any biases the
interviewers may have. The committee then determines whether to hire you or
not, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; once you're hired they place you in a department or project you're
interested in. So you don't interview for a particular position, and you're
not competing with other brains for the same job: it's just a matter of
whether you're up to snuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I had a really good time interviewing for Google, and despite
not getting the job consider it a great experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="linux-foundation"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Linux Foundation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't get as far into the LF interview process, but want to write
about it because their code challenge &lt;em&gt;consumed&lt;/em&gt; my life for a solid
week. This is mostly my own fault: the challenge was to create a
site using Drupal, which I have ample experience doing, and so
as a challenge I chose to use Drupal 8 instead of 7.  Never. Again.
Drupal 8 has some great and cool features, namely better templating.
But it's not well documented, not widely used, and is &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt;
different from Drupal 7. I was in way over my head, and honestly
spent probably close to 50 hours on a project that was supposed
to take 8.  I'm sure some LF folks will read this and chuckle,
but it was an emotional technical journey that I'm glad I took.
As arduous as it was, it feels strangely pleasurable to get sucked
into a project like that, and I learned a whole lot about Drupal.
This doesn't really reflect LF at all, but I guess can be
taken as a lesson regarding how great interviews can be regardless
of whether you get the job?  Or something.  I just thought you
all should know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="puppet"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Puppet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't go on about how much I enjoyed
interviewing at Puppet. I interned there the previous summer, so
much of that enjoyment was in seeing old friends and getting
lots of hugs. I also know that raving about stuff sounds
cheesy and fake like squeezy cheese, and this blog post is
not about squeezy cheese. Barf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puppet's interview was 6 45-minute interviews, each with 2
engineers from the team I would be working on, and including
a one-on-one lunch.  The interviews were pretty standard stuff
(tell us about yourself, answer technical questions, etc.), but
in interviewing my interviewers it was clear that Puppet
prioritized &lt;em&gt;having a life&lt;/em&gt; outside of work. Most people had
kids, and everyone had a variety of hobbies as well, from
motorcycling to painting to construction and so on.  I know
work-life balance isn't a key word for everyone, but
for me personally it was a huge relief to know that I wouldn't be
expected to work 60-80 hours/week and could pursue other
interests after hours.  Puppet 100%
won on diversity as well, with a wide variety of races, ages,
and gender non-binary interviewers.  All in all, it was
a really fun day, and cemented for me that Puppet was
the right place for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll emphasize again that I'm very biased, particularly since
I accepted the job at Puppet and had worked there previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started looking for a job in mid-November and accepted the
position at Puppet mid-March. Finding a job is &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;, even
as a fully-qualified, young, white woman with years of
previous work experience.  Not only is it hard to get an offer,
but it's hard to research companies you're interested in, optimize
your resume, apply, hope, schedule calls, take time between
classes talking to recruiters and engineers for hourse, fly or drive
offsite for a full day of interviews, hear &amp;quot;We're sorry but...&amp;quot; over
and over and over. I have to admit that I was expecting the
interview process to take time, but underestimated how much energy
and emotion and effort it would take.  I've learned a lot about
the job market, about what I value and need in a career, and
about where I stand in comparison with my peers. But I'm
also thrilled with where I landed, and could not be
more excited to start working at Puppet this summer. I
wish anyone reading this before job searching good luck,
and hope that your experiences are enlightening if not
fruitful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, remember:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don't get a position, it's not &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; fault.
I interview candidates for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://osuosl.org"&gt;OSU Open Source Lab&lt;/a&gt;
and most of the time a candidate is well-suited to the
position, but there's just someone else we think would be
a little bit better.  It's not personal, it's not mean,
it's not that you're not good enough. It's not &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think about your values, and whether a company aligns with
them. It's so tempting to just go for prestige: Google, Apple,
Intel, etc. But if you're not crazy about how that company
operates, or what it makes, you don't want to spend years
working there.  Do your research, and &lt;em&gt;know what you want&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies want the same thing you do: for this to be a good
fit! If they don't think it is, then maybe they're right:
maybe it's not the right place for you.  Find a company
that's stoked to bring you on board!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

valuable, usable, and do what you expect them to.  So, for the sake
of those like me, here are some of the applications I have found
particularly useful or entertaining. I should also mention that these are
all free and available on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://multco.lib.overdrive.com"&gt;Overdrive&lt;/a&gt;: You can connect overdrive to local libraries and checkout
books to read or listen to on mobile. I use it to download and listen to
audiobooks, and honestly went from reading 0 books/year to about 1/week.
It's completely changed my life, and made the mundane moments like doing
laundry or walking to class more entertaining.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.danoeh.antennapod&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;AntennaPod&lt;/a&gt;: Similar to Overdrive, this app brings you great listening
material in a different form: podcasts.  It has lots of fancy features now
like adjustable playback speed, automatic deletion once you've listened
to an episode, and turning off if you fall asleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=another.music.player&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Shuttle&lt;/a&gt;: This is just a music player I'm happy with. If you're happy
with your music player, I wouldn't worry about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.acorns.android&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Acorns&lt;/a&gt;: The idea here is that it rounds up any debit/credit card purchases

better than others.  I decided to get one because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I didn't want to be scared of permanently changing my body.&lt;/strong&gt;  We make
decisions that permanently alter the course of our life pretty often, in much
bigger ways than a tattoo will, and I know I will regret coming to the end
of my life with no permanent marks.  I have scars and birthmarks, it seemed
it was time to make a mark that I got to dictate, that represented some
aspect of myself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's a profoundly human experience&lt;/strong&gt;, and in general I like to experience
things other humans have in order to feel as though I've lived my life to
its fullest.  There are obvious lines I don't cross (ie. heroin), but even
the process of deciding on a design and getting it has taught me a lot.  If
you don't believe me, try it out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wanted to think long and hard about my life up to this point, and find
the parts that mattered the most.&lt;/strong&gt;  Of course, there's no need to get a
tattoo in order to do this.  However, I'm about to graduate from college and
begin The Rest Of My Life,  and for me personally a tattoo seems as good a
way as any to mark this turning point in my life and attempt to encapsulate
the last 21 years into something permanent that I can carry with me going
forward. This isn't to say that I can be boiled down into a single image or
phrase and have that put on my body, but it is to say that there are some
key points to represent symbolically that can help solidify my identity at
this point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They can be beautiful, and start conversations.&lt;/strong&gt; Nuff said.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with these intentions in mind, I set about getting a tattoo. In some ways
it was much easier than expected, in that there is a local tattoo parlor that
does high-quality work and is very safe. But on the whole it wasn't exactly
easy, as permanently changing your body using needles probably shouldn't be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="choosing-a-design"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Choosing a Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted the tattoo to be small, simple, and something I knew I wasn't likely
to regret.  It needed to represent some part of myself that wasn't liable to
change, and that I wouldn't be embarrassed to talk about.  With this criteria
in mind I had a few ideas of things that my tattoo could be &amp;quot;about&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portland, OR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something very generic + symbolic (ie. an equals sign)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was wary of quotes, as they seemed less pliable in their meaning, and seemed
more likely to &amp;quot;tire out&amp;quot; so to speak.  Besides, if I really liked a quote, I
had plenty of skin to get other tattoos in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researching designs brought up a few contenders:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-left"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/equal-tattoo.jpg" style="width: 30%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/sun-watercolor.jpg" style="width: 30%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/rose-tattoo.jpg" style="width: 30%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After consulting friends and learning more about what kinds of tattoos are
difficult to execute, and which aren't, I settled on this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/my-tattoo.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the portland, in plain black ink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go small at first! You have plenty of space to get bigger ones later,
and you'll know what you're getting yourself into.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get line art.  This limits what you can get quite a bit, but again
line art is so much easier to get, and you'll almost definitely be happier
with the finally product. You can always work your way up to large, colored
tats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go with as few colors as possible.  Colors just add time, complexity,
and money to the tattoo.  It doesn't have to be black and white, but if you
can turn your design into black and white and still love it, it's much
easier!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="getting-the-tattoo"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting the Tattoo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually getting my tattoo was easy and relatively painless. I had a super
brief consultation with the local parlor to get some questions answered and
show them my design, then made an appointment for a few days later.  The only
advice I received about prepping for getting the tattoo was pretty solid life
advice: drink lots of water, eat a good healthy meal before, get enough sleep.
Standard stuff. I got to my appointment &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; early (like, half an hour
early) because I was so nervous, and spent the time filling out some paperwork
and pacing.  My boyfriend came with me, which was very helpful. It was great
not just to have support there, but someone to talk to and experience this
with.  I said it was fine if he didn't come, but in retrospect I would not want
to get a tattoo alone. So, around 7 the tattoo artist set up the table, showed
me her rendering of the design, and then did this cool paper-to-skin thing so
you could basically see how the tattoo was going to look before getting inked.
It looked great, so we got started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My tattoo is on my ribs, which regular tattoo-getters will tell you is among
the more painful spots since it's so close to bone.  It definitely wasn't
comfortable, but my tattoo was so small and simple that it wasn't painful so
much as annoying. It feels like someone is rubbing the tip of a needle on your
skin, not like it's &lt;em&gt;cutting&lt;/em&gt; you, but just lightly scratch.  If you have a
really sharp pencil, you can try drawing on your skin, and that's about how it
feels.  My tattoo took about 10 minutes from start to finish, and with my beau
to keep me distracted it went by pretty quick.  My tattoo artist was also
incredibly sweet, understanding, and supportive, and made the whole experience
that much more pleasant. Once it was done, I took a look to make sure it all
looked good.  I won't get too cheesy, but it was love at first site. As anyone
is with their first tattoo, I was nervous that I would regret getting something
put permanently on my body, but I knew when I saw it that I had made the right
decision. Crisis: avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/my-tat-picture.jpeg" style="width: 40%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="post-tattoo"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Post-tattoo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super cool tattoo lady hooked me up with some tattoo-care products for totally
reasonable and worth-it prices, including a nice soap and lotion.  Since my
tattoo was so small and minimal it never hurt, turned red, itched, or any of
the other possible skin irritation that often come after getting a tattoo.  I
even forgot I had one the next day, and as I was getting ready for bed thought
&amp;quot;OH MY GOD WHAT HAPPENED oh right I got a tattoo&amp;quot;.  The lesson: start small!
It's been 100% painless as long as you take good care of it.  It's been exactly
1 week since I got it as of this writing, and by now it feels like a completely
normal and natural part of my body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I'm very happy with my tattoo, and the decision to get it. There are
totally unexpected side effects of empowerment, and my tattoo is not just a
reminder of where I come from but that my body is &lt;em&gt;mine&lt;/em&gt;, and that I get to
choose what happens to it. I have to admit that my parents explicitly didn't
approve of my getting one, and I was really hurt that they wouldn't support me.
I understand that as parents their job is to keep me safe and avoid regrettable
decisions, which a tattoo very well could be. But (as is hopefully evidenced by
this post!) I put a lot of thought and care into getting one, and wish that
they had been more understanding.  Luckily, it's not very visible, so no one
&lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to know.  Even if they do find out (probably through this post), it's my
body! Yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm thrilled that I can carry a piece of my childhood with me into adulthood
now, and know what it's like to be tattooed.  It's almost like being part of a
club, and has already sparked some very interesting and intimate conversations
with co-workers and friends about their tattoos, and how they decided to get
them.  I'm not sure what the best way to end this post is, but I hope it's
been helpful | insightful | interesting! Have an excellent day :)&lt;/p&gt;

shoutout for teaching me that happy + healthy &amp;gt; skinny.  My mom works &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;
for her body, doing an hour-long cardio and strength class (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.jazzercise.com/"&gt;Jazzercise&lt;/a&gt;)
at least 5 days a week.  For more than 30 years. And it shows -- she has
great blood pressure, a healthy heart rate, and can walk way farther and longer
than my brother or I (seriously, bring comfortable walking shoes if you
ever go on vacation with us. Lessons learned the hard way.).  In fact,
a few years ago my mom had her gallbladder removed, came home and
cooked dinner &lt;em&gt;that night&lt;/em&gt;. If that's not strong and healthy, call me
a monkey's uncle.  She also eats what she wants, when she wants, to
help her body feel good.  From not having a scale in the house, to
prioritizing intellect and personality over looks, to
emphasizing exercise and good food, my mom built an ideal body-image
foundation.  This isn't to say I've always had a healthy
relationship with food, but it's been easy to develop one.  I'm
so grateful to my mom for helping me see that your waistline
doesn't indicate how healthy you are, that big hispanic booties
are a great ass-et, and that exercising and eating to feel good
will make me way happeir (and healthier) than dieting ever will.&lt;/p&gt;

this highly anticipated read, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Hunger-Makes-Me-Modern-Girl/dp/1594486638"&gt;Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl&lt;/a&gt; by
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.carriebrownstein.com/"&gt;Carrie Brownstein&lt;/a&gt;. Brownstein's memoir of her
time in the band &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sleater-kinney.com/"&gt;Sleater-Kinney&lt;/a&gt;, this book was raw to the point
of discomfort. Whatever opinions I may have, they're outweighed
by the respect I have for Brownstein's openness, vulnerability, and honesty.
The whole book, beginning to end, is one long intimate passage into
the private lives of herself, her family, and her bandmates, sharing
details I would cringe to tell my own friends, let alone publish
for the world to read. More than anything I'm in awe of her
talent for writing and fearless storytelling.  After the
amazement at her baring-all, though, I had a few other thoughts
on the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went in with few expectations and
scattered knowledge of Carrie Brownstein. I knew from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/"&gt;All Songs Considered&lt;/a&gt;
that she was a member of Sleater-Kinney, that she had worked briefly
for that podcast, and of course knew about her role in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ifc.com/shows/portlandia"&gt;Portlandia&lt;/a&gt;.
But I had never listened to Sleater-Kinney's music, much less studied their
past or had any part in the Pacific Northwest punk scene. In hindsight,
doing a little bit of studying before hand would have been helpful --
the book catalogs her experiences before, during, and briefly after
Sleater-Kinney exclusively, and she frequently references bands and
events I had never heard of, despite being so geographically and
temporally close to them.  This was a bug and a feature: knowing so
little made the book more educational, interesting, and worthwhile,
but also in many ways less meaningful or impactful for me personally.
That said, Brownstein includes so much more than just a history of
the band.  Her struggles with anxiety and depression, a variety
of physical conditions including shingles and an allergy to soy,
and hypochondria while touring with a band, are very much relatable
to any who has battled those same battles. She also speaks at length
of coming of age and finding what she wanted to do, of how her parents
own repressed selves affected her childhood, and of other
profound thoughts on the human experience in the modern age, and how
to navigate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, &amp;quot;Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl&amp;quot; was an enjoyable
and worthwhile read. Entertaining, insightful, and almost unbearably
honest, I would highly recommend picking this up if you have a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

I plan to start reviewing the books I read (or, rather, listen to).
I'm currently making my way through the Harry Potter series again, but in
the meantime got a chance to read &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Ready-Player-One-A-Novel/dp/0307887448"&gt;Ready Player One by Ernest Cline&lt;/a&gt;.  Set
30 years in the future, Ready Player One depicts a bleak distopia where
a MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role playing game) called the OASIS
is the only escape from reality, and has in fact replaced it.  The novel
follows teenager Wade Watts through a Hunger Games-esque competition
requiring expansive and detailed knowledge of 80's tech culture, from
video games to movies to comic books and beyond.  This is a total candy
read, and if you're into science fiction or Neal Stephenson novels
(particularly &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Reamde-A-Novel-Neal-Stephenson/dp/0062191497"&gt;Reamde&lt;/a&gt;), this
would definitely be a good weekend pick-me-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, it didn't hit my literary sweet spot, but then again I can't
say I expected it to. I will say it was much more accessible than I expected
it to be, and aligned perfectly with my values: intellect winning out over
money; strong, rich, diverse characters; well researched but not obscure.
Candy Read.  Without giving too much away (fear not, read on), what made
it most enjoyable was the very distinct Good vs. Evil dynamic, and how
each party was very clearly on one side or the other. It was easy to root
for the the protagonists, against the antagonists, and just be along for
the plot-ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's all she wrote.  My next review will be sometime next week on
Carrie Brownstein's memoir &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Hunger-Makes-Me-Modern-Girl/dp/1594486638"&gt;Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Day 0:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pulled up to the venue at about 5:30 Friday night, T-90 minutes to Ignite
talks.  I chugged a chocolate milk from the &amp;quot;gift store&amp;quot;, ran through my
slides one last time, got dinner with the bosses, and found myself on a stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-ignite-talks"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Ignite Talks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deb Nicholson, &lt;strong&gt;The Foss Awakens&lt;/strong&gt;. How collaboration and mentoring
are a force for good, told with Star Wars images. Grade-A speaker, definitely
delivered. Great way to start the evening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gilbert Standen, &lt;strong&gt;Building Oracle on LXC&lt;/strong&gt;. He lost me at &amp;quot;Oracle&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Me. &lt;strong&gt;Rocking the House&lt;/strong&gt;.  But seriously, people laughed at my jokes,
I got high-fived, it went better than expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dave Nielsen, &lt;strong&gt;Redis&lt;/strong&gt;. Kind of informative, kind of boring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emily Dunham, &lt;strong&gt;Where's the Cloud&lt;/strong&gt;. Much like Deb, Emily is a veteran
speaker and it shows. Funny, informative, ended on a pun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don Marti, &lt;strong&gt;Web ads&lt;/strong&gt;. I would have appreciated it more if I was less sleepy
I think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Justin King, &lt;strong&gt;Choosing a Framework for your project&lt;/strong&gt;. Knowledgable and
well spoken, it's pretty great to watch a not-adult give a talk.  They have
great perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corey Quinn: &lt;strong&gt;Docker Must Die: Heresy in the Church of Docker&lt;/strong&gt;. So, so
funny. Dude is a master.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some good laughs, I headed back up to my room, realized how
overwhelmingly underprepared I was for my talk, finished up my slides and hit
the hay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="day-1"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 1:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woke up early and got breakfast at this adorable bakery, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/euro-pane-bakery-pasadena"&gt;Euro Pane&lt;/a&gt;.
Ran through the talk once for good measure, then headed over to the Key Note,
by Mark Shuttleworth. Honestly, it was pretty much a sales pitch, and I
wasn't really into it. But at least I didn't feel bad leaving early. I headed
over to my room, set everything up, then walked around to get out the nerves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="my-talk"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My Talk&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://slides.lucywyman.me/modifying-the-kernel.html"&gt;Modifying the Kernel: A How-to&lt;/a&gt;
Not my best, not my worst. I got across the information I wanted to, and got
lots of positive feedback after the talk and throughout the day. More than
anything, I'm relieved that it's over and I can cross it off of my
to-do list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="lunch"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lunch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had guacamole, made tableside. It was &lt;em&gt;bomb&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="keila-banks-automated-teen"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keila Banks, Automated Teen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was really excited for this talk, and was a little let down. Between mic
issues, some nerves, and being a little out of touch with the conference,
I didn't get what I wanted to out of the talk.  All of that said, I have a
lot of respect for Keila giving a talk to such a big room, and for getting up
there in the first place. I'm excited to see what she does in the future, and
hope to see her at other Open Source conferences soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="justin-mayer-essential-linux-security"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Justin Mayer, Essential Linux Security&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was pretty nearly the perfect talk.  I learned about a lot of valuable
tools, including changes you can make to your SSH configs, creating SSL
certificates with Let's Encrypt, HSTS, CSP, and other tools to make my
computer and websites safer.  In Justin's words, &amp;quot;Think of the children&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="brandon-philips-etcd"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Brandon Philips, Etcd&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also a great talk. Brandon is obviously a well-practiced speaker who
seemed very comfortable on stage.  He's also incredibly knowledgeable, and it
was clear that this talk was only skimming the surface of what he knows on
the subject of etcd. I also didn't know very much about etcd or CoreOS going
in to the talk -- I even thought the d was for daemon :p -- so stood to get
a lot out of it. And I did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see some of the demos he did at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/philips/hacks/tree/master/etcd-demos"&gt;https://github.com/philips/hacks/tree/master/etcd-demos&lt;/a&gt;,
or learn more about CoreOS at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://coreos.com/"&gt;https://coreos.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Day 2:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning was absolutely &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt; in Pasadena.  I got to walk around
for a while before everyone else woke up, and soak in some Sunday Morning
magic. I don't know. There's something about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="keynote-sarah-sharp-on-diversity"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keynote: Sarah Sharp on Diversity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said a lot of really important things, but they're also things that everyone
has heard before.  She knows her stuff, and seems very passionate, but that
keynote isn't going to change anything.  Call me a cynic, but from the two
guys behind me asking &amp;quot;Why should minorities get a stipend just for getting an
internship?&amp;quot; to ethnic homogeneity of the audience, I don't hold much hope
for tech companies realizing how important diversity of their workforce is
any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="randal-schwartz-intro-to-dart"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Randal Schwartz, Intro to Dart&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I spent this whole talk just working on making this blog. Woops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="other-things-i-saw-today"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other Things I Saw Today&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two pugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three grown men yell group hug and execute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the rest of the day doing homework and travelling. It's amazing how
much effort it takes to move a human from A to B, and I have to say I was
so exhausted by the time we got to Corvallis around 12:30.  Lesson learned:
I am not a Sunday-worker. Sundays are for blankets and tea and tv, not
late night flights and talking to other humans.  Overall, SCaLE was
less stressful than I thought it would be, and I don't regret going
like I thought I would. Maybe that sounds lukewarm, and I have to say
it is a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; well run conference, and my particular sentiments don't
reflect a lack of effort on the part of the organizers,
presenters, or exhibitors. Objectively, it's a great conference.  I'm
not really sure how to end this post. I might think of something
better later. For now, ciao gentle reader. You excellent human you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
