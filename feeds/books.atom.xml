campaign (not as DM, just playing!), and of course went to a pumpkin patch. Everything we did was
fun, and the weather in Portland was &lt;em&gt;gorgeous&lt;/em&gt;. It's been a beautiful, wonderful, spooky October,
and I'm admittedly sad to see it end. I'm also looking forward to Thanksgiving and more time with
family though, so can hardly complain. This month's books were, overall, not great. I've maxed out
my holds at the library and books are taking FOREVER to come in now (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://p2a.co/fgcQkzV"&gt;fuck publishers&lt;/a&gt;), so I'm
ending up with books that happen to be available a bit more. Anywho, here's what I read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="jane-steele-4-5"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25868918-jane-steele"&gt;Jane Steele&lt;/a&gt;: 4/5&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/jane-steele.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite not having read Jane Eyre (which the novel is inspired by and frequently references) I found
I connected a lot with this book, and mostly with it's heroine. Jane Steele, as her name suggests,
is a strong-willed and righteous murderer - though she only murders &lt;em&gt;horrible&lt;/em&gt; men who have wronged
the women in their lives! So...it's kind of ok. She's like a 19th century English Dexter, although a
bit more sympathetic. What I liked about Jane was how strong her relationships in the book were -
her complex friendship with her best friend Clark, her protective instincts toward those who help
her, and ultimately her love interest. Jane reads like living in the mind of a real person, with
doubts and convictions and feelings all expressed throughout the book. It was fun to live in her
crazy and curious world for a while, and I'd definitely read a sequel!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RIYL&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10210.Jane_Eyre"&gt;Jane Eyre&lt;/a&gt;, Jane Porter in Tarzan, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5899779-pride-and-prejudice-and-zombies"&gt;Pride and Prejudice and Zombies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="okay-fine-whatever-2-5"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35397338-okay-fine-whatever"&gt;Okay, Fine, Whatever&lt;/a&gt;: 2/5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Courtenay Hameister&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/okay-fine-whatever.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly...this title feels appropriate. I wanted to like this more than I did, especially after
reading about how hard Hameister takes criticism (I'm sorry!). But the book just didn't resonate
with me. As someone with very mild anxiety I thought I could connect to someone overcoming their
fears, and in Portland OR no less. It turns out Hameister and I don't share the same anxieties or
coping mechanisms, and throughtout the book I mostly just thought &amp;quot;Oh thank God I'm not her&amp;quot;. Don't
worry, she gets a happy ending, and the book isn't as much of a downer as I'm making it out to be.
If you are experiencing anxiety, or evaluating making a change in your life, I think this book would
be more meaningful. It just wasn't for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/bookish-life-of-nina-hill.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a sweet but forgettable rom-com read. Nina Hill is an almost-great character, a cliche
bookworm who struggles with her love life. What I liked most about Nina was what a strong network of
female friends she had. From coworkers to her trivia team, Nina was introverted without being
isolated. I also liked that the conflict in the book was both realistic....and towards the end a bit
silly and off-the-rails ðŸ™‚. If you're looking for a palate-cleanser or an easy read, this is a fun
one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved the thesis of this book, my only complaint was that it was hammered home a few too many
times. And for good reason, since most of us spend our &lt;em&gt;entire childhoods&lt;/em&gt; learning that math is
rigid, and strict, and hard. Cheng aims to break that misconception by demonstrating how math is
creative and fun, how it's about breaking the rules of math and seeing what happens (like with
imaginary numbers). She attempts to rebuild our understanding of what math is from the ground up
using metaphors and real-world scenarios, and illustrates her points beautifully. This is a
fantastic book for a teen or pre-teen wondering why they need to be in math class, or for anyone
looking to add a little more math to their day-to-day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a lot to like and appreciate about this book, but not a lot to love. This is classic Ann
Patchett: a deeply human story about a perfectly normal family that, when you examine closely, isn't
so normal. Her characters and their relationships are so rich, described exclusively through 'show'
and not tell which gives them quirkiness and specificity that's downright delightful. I also love
the span of her book - you get to be with the characters as they develop and change from childhood,
a sort of built-in character growth that isn't forced. I have mixed feelings about how little plot
there was - I liked the smaller mini-stories through the book, and that the focus was so heavily on
the characters, with the entire &amp;quot;plot&amp;quot; spoiled halfway through the book. With all that's to like
about the book though, I didn't find myself deeply invested in the characters. They were fine, but I
wasn't dying to read each next page. I guess that's how many of Patchett's books are, but it still
keeps this one from being a 5 star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/incomplete-book-of-running.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book was not intended for me. Firstly I've never listened to 'Wait Wait Don't Tell Me', so
while I vaguely knew Peter Sagal I was hardly a fan. Secondly I'm already an avid runner, and the
book was intended for this looking to get into running. The book is part memoir about a person I'm
not invested in (who assumes you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; invested in him - you did pick up his book afterall), and
part argument for why you should start running, which...I already am. So, I didn't get a lot out of
it. Also I found out about 2/3 of the way through that he's remarried to someone who is 18 years his
junior, and while I know that love is love and I'm sure she's great or whatever it just creeped me
out and I couldn't keep listening. Call me judgmental, you're not wrong. Anyway, I'm not sure I'd
recommend this book to anyone. I'd say you should read &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6289283-born-to-run"&gt;Born to Run&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned when reading &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44279110-my-year-of-rest-and-relaxation"&gt;My Year of Rest and Relaxation&lt;/a&gt; that I'm not particularly drawn to novels
about sadness, or drugs, or poverty, let alone all three in one book. I could only stomach about
half the book before giving up. The reality of the book isn't very pleasant to live in, and while
there are plenty of uncomfortable books that are worth powering through and considering deeply I
didn't feel like I was getting anything out of reading this. That's not entirely true - I think it
gave me some understanding of what it's like to be poor in America, to deal with mental illness and
have no support system. But...then a book I wanted to read more (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42202046-waking-the-witch"&gt;Waking the Witch&lt;/a&gt;) came in and I
gave up on this one. I'm sure I'm a worse person for it, but also a happier one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="eight-hundred-grapes-3-5"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23492613-eight-hundred-grapes"&gt;Eight Hundred Grapes&lt;/a&gt;: 3/5&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/eight-hundred-grapes.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was definitely a small step up from the last novel of Dave's I read, &lt;em&gt;Hello Sunshine&lt;/em&gt;. I
appreciated that the central conflict of the book isn't just &amp;quot;Will she get the guy?&amp;quot;, but was about
her career and direction of her life. The heroine was relatable and imperfect, and the story did a
good job of exploring the messiness and complication of real life without having such a heavy &amp;quot;novel
facade&amp;quot;, which I think tends to skim over those details. Her parents relationship in particular
resonated with me, as it was neither a fairytale nor a nightmare but a regular old marriage, full of
compromise and heartache and love. I doubt I'll remember much about this book a few months from now,
but for a short time it was a good book to escape into.&lt;/p&gt;

their stories unfold, taking time to include important and character-defining

general world that Stradal creates. I highly recommend!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/flatshare.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For such a terrible cover, this was a great novel! Tiffy and Leon were both
wonderful characters, and while the plot was a bit predictable it also wasn't
boring, and kept me wanting to read more. I loved how endearing and real both
characters were, and how I was genuinely rooting for them. I thought their
flaws made them human, and I empathized with them both. One of the better
rom-com novels I've read this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-bride-test-4-5"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still haven't read the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36199084-the-kiss-quotient"&gt;The Kiss Quotient&lt;/a&gt;, Hoang's acclaimed first novel,
but somehow this second in the series found it's way to my library playlist
first. I see now why &lt;em&gt;The Kiss Quotient&lt;/em&gt; was talked about for months! &lt;em&gt;The
Bride Test&lt;/em&gt; follows Esme Tran as she leaves her mother and small daughter in Ho
Chi Minh city for the opportunity to travel to America to go on a blind date
with a wealthy woman's son. Khai has high-functioning autism, and is initially
cold to Esme's attempts to win his heart. But over the summer, in a sudden plot
twist, they &lt;em&gt;gasp&lt;/em&gt; fall for each other. Though predictable this book was
charming, and I loved both characters. They were genuinely annoying at times in
a way that was refreshing - they weren't coyly avoiding each other, and there
were no plot devices super obvious plot devices to drive them apart. Their
strife was genuine, and so their affection felt more genuine. I already have
&lt;em&gt;The Kiss Quotient&lt;/em&gt; on hold as well, and can't wait to read more in this
wonderful series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="mariam-sharma-hits-the-road-4-5"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35230406-mariam-sharma-hits-the-road"&gt;Mariam Sharma Hits the Road&lt;/a&gt;: 4/5&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hit home just how uncool I was in high school. The book centers on three
teenagers, two who are Pakistani Muslim and one who is Indian-Pakistani. The
book explores complex issues in a way that respects their complexity, looking
at it from multiple sides and trying to understand the layers and opinions of
each player. For example one teenager is closeted gay and Muslim, with devout
parents. He grapples with his religion, hating it for making his parents hate
gays but also loving God and finding comfort in the rituals and community. What
I liked most about this book was the perspective it gave me, living the world
of southeast-asian teenagers in the modern age, and the constant daily
expectations and judgments they face from the public and their own community.
It was also a relatively light and fun read, and the friendship between
protagonists is wonderful. An excellent teen adventure book with a little more
weight to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/waiting-for-tom-hanks.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this book was always ill-fated for me since...I don't &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; Tom Hanks.
He's a great actor! And I love &lt;em&gt;Forrest Gump&lt;/em&gt;. I have nothing against the man
personally. But when I think of my favorite actors, particularly those I lust
after, Tom Hanks is pretty low on the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was Annie's pining for Hanks that felt unbelievable then. Or the fact
that a movie star would fall for a lamer version of Bella Swan, if such a thing
is possible. In the end I only made it maybe 1/3 of the way through before
giving up. It wasn't among the worst books I've ever read, but definitely
wasn't worth my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having just watched all of &amp;quot;Broad City&amp;quot; this summer, I had no idea Abbi had
written a book until I came across it at Powell's. I liked the book because I
love Abbi, and already care about her as a person. But I don't know that on
it's own it would be a great read. The memoir follows Abbi on a road trip she
took between the 4th and 5th seasons of the show. It's full of classic Abbi
Jacobson humor and overthinking, while also being vulnerable and talking about
her insecurities and fears. It was, on reflection, an excellent balance of
reality and humor, of candor and levity, but for some reason it just didn't
resonate with me. I think I don't empathize with a lot of Abbi's fears, and so
they felt sad and pitying rather than joyous in finding I wasn't alone in those
fears. That said, the book is very well written, and if you do share her
tribulations and enjoy her humor it will be a fantastic read.&lt;/p&gt;

acknolwedged by your peers has a lot of positive outcomes, including longer
lifespan, greater professional success, higher reported happiness, etc. He
describes 5 categories of popularity that people fall into: average, accepted,
neglected, rejected, and controversial. While where you fall on this spectrum
is largely based in genetics and early childhood, Prinstein suggests that we
have more control over our standing on the spectrum than we may realize. He
argues that trying to become more likable, as opposed to gaining status via
wealth or power, will win you friends. This was like a very research driven
version of &lt;em&gt;How to Win Friends and Influence People&lt;/em&gt;, and while it was
interesting I'm not sure I'll remember very much of the book a month from now.&lt;/p&gt;

We visited friends in Corvallis, and my extended family in Bend, OR. We celebrated a one year anniversary with a big backyard barbecue, and a birthday with a hike and picnic brunch. Literarily the month was less great - I chose what I thought would be fun and easy, summery books many of which just turned out to be plain bad. If there's one thing I've learned from reading so much this year, it's that there are a lot of bad books that get published. I guess 'bad' is too generic a term though, and who am I to say a book is bad? I suppose it's better to say books I can't appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what I read in August:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="fleishman-is-in-trouble"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41880602-fleishman-is-in-trouble"&gt;Fleishman Is in Trouble&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taffy Brodesser-Akner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/fleishman-is-in-trouble.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After listening to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/06/the-cut-on-tuesdays-podcast-taffy-brodesser-akner-fleishman-is-in-trouble.html"&gt;an interview with the author&lt;/a&gt; I was overly hyped about
this book (which I guess is the point of interviews). The protagonist, Toby
Fleishman, is bizarrely (though apparently not overtly) reminiscent of Toby
Flenderson from &amp;quot;The Office&amp;quot;. He's limp and pitiable, and seems to know it. His
noodleness is directed not just outward but inward too - he doesn't like
himself, but is too noodly to do anything about it. Being on the opposite side
of marriage I can't bear to read about bad experiences with it - I'm too
jealous that they even got married in the first place, and mad that they've
gone and fucked it up. It's irrational, but between that and an intentionally
not-quite-likeable protagonist, I just couldn't power through. I think if
you're interested in interpersonal relationships, or are going through divorce,
this will resonate with you. Otherwise I don't think the book quite stands on
it's own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="juliet-s-school-of-possibilities"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40641078-juliet-s-school-of-possibilities"&gt;Juliet's School of Possibilities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/juliets-school-of-possibilities.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was overall a nice book, if heavy-handed with the parable. The book
follows Riley Jenkins, who starts out struggling to hold together her job and
relationships. She attends the 'school' of Martha Stewart-esque homemaker /
life coach, who tells Riley:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
 Expectations are infinite.
 Time is finite.
 You are always choosing.
 Choose well.

I liked the moral of the story, though can't say it's changed my life since
finishing the book. Riley's whole life turns around the course of a few pages
after beginning to implement this lesson, which I think is just a concession
you have to make to the book. The author explains in a post-script that she's
a time management coach who had so many conversations with people like Riley,
and wrote the book to spread the same message she tells her clients. A quick
and healthy dose of self-help, but not a must-read.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="naturally-tan"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/"&gt;Naturally Tan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tan France&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/naturally-tan.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! The &amp;quot;Queer Eye&amp;quot; fashion expert you know and love wrote a book, in case you
didn't love him enough already. Tan (are we on a first name basis? I hope so)
is such a gem. His narration is so sassy, and his book balances serious stories
with fun and funny moments. The book reads like a conversation, and it was fun
to get to know Tan better as a human. His perspectives on fame, culture, and of
course fashion all gave me new ways of seeing the world. It broke my heart
hearing about his childhood as a Pakistani in England, and how he was bullied
and beaten up regularly just for being brown. Even today TSA regularly pulls
him aside for 'random search', and he has to represent all of southeast asia in
the media because that group is so underrepresented on TV. If you love &amp;quot;Queer
Eye&amp;quot;, this is a must read!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS I highly recommend the audiobook - there's a special guest appearance in the middle of the book and that's all I'll say!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="natalie-tan-s-book-of-luck-and-fortune"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42051103-natalie-tan-s-book-of-luck-and-fortune"&gt;Natalie Tan's Book of Luck and Fortune&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roselle Lim&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/natalie-tans-book-of-luck-and-fortune.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oof. This was too YA to even be a YA book. The book was mostly the narration of
the protagonist telling us about her feelings, instead of expressing them or
showing them. She comes to realizations - sometimes the wrong realizations -
without any prompting or events to help her realize them. The book and narrator
have a flat worldview where everything is good or bad and way oversimplified,
making it intolerably unrealistic and uninteresting. I gave up halfway through,
and don't regret it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="meet-cute"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41063454-meet-cute"&gt;Meet Cute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/meet-cute.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggressively generic and flat story - which didn't even have a good meet cute!
This PG-13 romance stars 2 lawyers, at first rivals from law school who then
become friends and then lovers all while she is a conservateur for his little
sister in a custody battle with his aunt. The characters were one-note and
remarkably dumb, and read more like the exaggerated characters from a kids
movie than adults. The plot was slightly better though the pacing was jerky,
spending lots of pages on the boring parts then wrapping up the interesting
bits in only a dozen pages. In hindsight I
should have given up halfway through on this one as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="hello-sunshine"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27274420-hello-sunshine"&gt;Hello Sunshine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Laura Dave&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/hello-sunshine.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a sweet and satisfying book. It follows youtube cooking celebrity
Sunshine Mackenzie's (real surname: Stevens) fall from grace, which forces her
to move back home and realize what she sacrificed for fame. I love that it
focused on a woman's career, and was filled with strong women who weren't
talking about who to marry. It was an interesting plot, and while the
instagram-is-terrible 'moral' was a little heavy-handed it made sense
narratively. This was a great chick lit, summer read!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celine: what a woman! I adored Celine, an experienced private investigator who
spent her career reuniting separated families. She was quirky and smart,
confident and matter-of-fact, and always one step ahead. Not only was she an

spent her career reuniting separated families. She was quirky and smart,
confident and matter-of-fact, and always one step ahead. Not only was she an
incredible and rich leading character, the plot was mysterious and exciting,
without being scary or cruel. I stayed up late and woke up early wanting to
know what would happen next, but didn't have nightmares about it. Honestly I'd
recommend &amp;quot;Celine&amp;quot; to just about everyone, especially if you like a good
mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="southern-lady-code"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40983137-southern-lady-code"&gt;Southern Lady Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/southern-lady-code.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a cultural disconnect between me and &amp;quot;Southern Lady Code&amp;quot;. It didn't
help that I went in with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cupofjo.com/2019/05/best-books-spring-2019/"&gt;high expectations&lt;/a&gt;, and have never even visited the
south. The book felt of another era to me - hilarious and rebellious if you're
a 50's housewife and have all the expectations therein placed on you. The
chapter on deciding not to have kids read as revolutionary, and while it's sad
and terrifying to think that for a lot of women that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; revolutionary and
courageous for me....it isn't. &lt;em&gt;Shrug&lt;/em&gt;. I think southern ladies will get a kick
out of this book, but for me it was a miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="save-me-the-plums"&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/save-me-the-plums.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might be the only person on earth that had never heard of Ruth Reichl or
&lt;em&gt;Gourmet&lt;/em&gt; before picking up this book, and I &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; it. Ruth is a natural
storyteller, describing people and experiences in technicolor detail. It feels
like you're &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;, in Paris enjoying dizzyingly good food, or in the cramped
elevator with Anna Wintour wondering what she's thinking. The book is so warm,
and Ruth's love for Gourmet is in every word of this memoir. I can't wait to
read her other writing - in the meantime this must be on your TBR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="evvie-drake-starts-over"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40514431-evvie-drake-starts-over"&gt;Evvie Drake Starts Over&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/evvie-drake-starts-over.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a solidly ok romantic read. I like the gentle and realistic way that
Evvie and Dean's relationship evolves, and that their conflicts didn't feel
constructed or fake. I liked that they weren't your typical perfect
hero-and-herione, and that there wasn't a fairytale ending where everything ~
magically ~ works out. At the same time there wasn't a lot that stood out about
the book - it was a cute summer read, nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="between-the-world-and-me"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25489625-between-the-world-and-me"&gt;Between the World and Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/between-the-world-and-me.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What an incredible read. Like much of Coates' work it's poetic and profound, and for a white girl like me eye-opening. The book is about race in America, and Coates' personal history with experiences and explorations of it. From his rough, impoverished Baltimore childhood to studying at Howard University to visiting a Civil War memorial with his family, Coates' lyrically describes his own realizations about being a black man in America. This was one of my favorite passages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
Slavery is not an indefinable mass of flesh. It is a particular, specific
enslaved woman whose mind is as active as your own, whose range of feelings
as vast as your own, who prefers the way the light falls in one particular
spot in the woods, who enjoys fishing where the water eddys in the nearby
stream, who loves her mother in her own complicated way, thinks her sister
talks to loud, has a favorite cousin, a favorite season, who excels at dress
making, and knows inside herself that she is as intelligent and capable as
anyone.

Slavery is the same woman born in a world that loudly proclaims its love of
freedom and describes this world in essential texts. A world in which these
same professors hold this woman a slave. Hold her mother a slave, her father
a slave, her daughter a slave
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was initially interesting book, but got long towards the end. It's the
story of Abbigail, a single-mom who's brother has been missing for 20 years.
There are many interesting mysteries that slowly come to light, but one is
revealed way too fast (if you ask me) and the other way too slow. I thought it
was a sweet read, but was ready to move on to other books about 3/4 of the way
through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was such a refreshing and smart YA read. I loved the voice and
confidence of Emoni, and loved how real the story, conflicts, and
characters were. It didn't feel overdone or dramatic, and it was
unexpected yet realistic how casual Emoni was about having a baby, and
how much she loved her baby. Highly recommended for young adults and
old adults alike!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-garden-party"&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/the-garden-party.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Garden Party&lt;/em&gt; reminded me of Gabriel Garcia-Marquez' &lt;em&gt;100 Years of
Solitude&lt;/em&gt; in terms of it's atmosphere and eccentricity. The book is dreamy and
fantastic, firmly in reality but just at the edge of it, and I liked that it
was electric without veering into zaniness. Despite liking the vibe of the
book, I'll admit I started to get a bit lost in jumping between conversations,
and gave up entirely on it when it came due at the library maybe 3/4 of the way
through. If you liked &lt;em&gt;A Mid-Summer Night's Dream&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;100 Years of Solitude&lt;/em&gt;,
you'd like this modern tale too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gretchen Rubin seems like such a happy, lovely person, and I enjoy reading and
listening to her just for a dose of happy-go-lucky. That said I find I never I
actually follow her advice. I thought this book would make me want to purge and
clean, but instead found that I was already pretty happy with the state of my
posessions - probably because we had just moved, so had already &amp;quot;Kondo'd&amp;quot; our
things. I gave up halfway through in pursuit of more interesting reads (per
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gretchenrubin.com/2014/07/13-tips-for-getting-more-reading-done/"&gt;Gretchen's own advice&lt;/a&gt;!), but if you like Gretchen as I do then you'll like

&lt;p&gt;This book &lt;em&gt;hit the spot&lt;/em&gt;. It was so cute and fun without being too sugary or
saccharine, with great characters and interesting conflict (if a bit crazy). If
you liked &lt;em&gt;Miss Congeniality&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Legally Blonde&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;The Princess Diaries&lt;/em&gt;,

&lt;p&gt;I was not ready for the intensity and emotional depth of this book. What I
thought would be yet another romance novel was a fantastic novel about the
reality of abuse, and in particular being abused by a famous professional
athlete. Time and again athletes get a mere slap on the wrist for abusing their
partners, and this book highlights just how powerless both physically and
socially those partners are. Don't get me wrong - there were also plenty of
great sex scenes with a non-abusive partner, and a lot of the typical
over-simplification of emotions and sex that romance novels are known for. But
this book gave me a better understanding of what abuse victims suffer, and as
terrible as this sounds an appreciation for the men in my life. If you like
Colleen Hoover, or want a typical romance novel with way more grit and
emotional twists, then this is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an intense read this was a refreshing palate cleanser. I'll use the back-of-the-book summary:
.. line-block:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
Having just been dumped by his girlfriend, British-born Hugo is still
determined to take his last-hurrah-before-college train trip across the
United States. One snag: the companion ticket is already booked under the
name of his ex, Margaret Campbell. Nontransferable, no exceptions.

Enter the new Margaret C. (Mae for short), an aspiring filmmaker with big
dreams. After finding Hugo's spare ticket offer online, she's convinced
it's the perfect opportunity to expand her horizons
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a whimsical and adorable coming-of-age, young-love story. It was fun
without feeling meaningless, and captured that summer-crush teenage-romance
feeling without feeling overly romanticized (high school wasn't &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; great).
Highly recommend if you're looking for a quick and fluffy read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/ayesha-at-last.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book helped me realize how intolerant I am of religion - almost certainly
too intolerant. I like to think of myself as 'live-and-let-live', and I would
&lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; tell anyone else what to believe or how to be. But listening to the
thoughts of truly devout people was uncomfortable, and I found it took a lot of
character development for me to like the more religious characters. Because of
this, and because of the portrayal of modern struggle between religion and
culture and modernity, I thought this was a great book. Ayesha is a strong and
likable character, and while I wasn't rooting for her love interest I was
rooting for her, which kept me hooked. A great combination vegetable-candy book
(or as I like to think, a fruit book), you'll like this one if you liked
&lt;em&gt;Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Bend it Like Beckham&lt;/em&gt;. In fact....I
think I'd recommend you just read &lt;em&gt;Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows&lt;/em&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="america-for-beginners"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35098009-america-for-beginners"&gt;America for Beginners&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/america-for-beginners.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was an endearing, heartwarming, unexpectedly melancholy novel. It
follows an Indian widow - rid of her isolating, emotionally abusive
husband - on her search for her gay son in America. The adventure of
course goes sideways, and is full of cultural conflict, examining
prejudices, and realizing that we're all similar. An uplifting read -
but be prepared with tissues at the end!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="i-remember-nothing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8242117-i-remember-nothing"&gt;I Remember Nothing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/i-remember-nothing.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My latest Nora Ephron, I found this one was hard to connect to. It's
all about her experience of aging, and I felt the generational
disconnect. I'd love to pick this up again when I'm 40 or 50, but for
now it just felt melancholy and foreign, and made me afraid of getting
older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="mirror-shoulder-signal"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36253052-mirror-shoulder-signal"&gt;Mirror, Shoulder, Signal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/mirror-shoulder-signal.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one didn't quite do it for me either. It's about a 40-something
Danish woman struggling to move on from a rough childhood. It's sparse
on details though, and I found Sonja's anxieties and murky past hard
to read about. It's simultaneous distressing and not terribly
interesting, and felt weirdly empty of both plot and characters. In
the end I moved on to more enjoyable reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="swearing-is-good-for-you"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40180029-swearing-is-good-for-you"&gt;Swearing is Good for You&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a long-form podcast, this was a super interesting and well
written book! It looks at swearing from every angle - why we do it,
how it's changed over time, how it affects our brains. Everyone swears
or has opinions on cussing, so it's definitely relevant to your life
and makes for great conversations with just about anyone. It's
scientific yet accessible - at one point the author even cites her own
paper! Some of my favorite learnings are that monkeys will create new
words from the words they know which resulted in them calling radishes
&amp;quot;cry food&amp;quot;, and that calling someone's mother a &amp;quot;das Schwein&amp;quot; (pig) in
Germany is one of the most offensive curses (like, actually &lt;em&gt;do not
say it&lt;/em&gt;).  If you listen to a lot of science podcasts or like
nonfiction this is a great read!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-life-less-throwaway"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35450524-a-life-less-throwaway"&gt;A Life Less Throwaway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming off of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13330588-happy-city"&gt;Happy City&lt;/a&gt; I wanted to know more about reducing the
waste I produce - not just in trash, but in buying things I don't need
or use. This ended up being too much preaching for me. Despite the
authors helpful, actionable exercises, the well researched and planned
solutions to the social problem of buying too much, I found I wasn't
getting very much out of it. It was geared toward someone who was more
skeptical and 'early' in their own-less journey, and honestly I also
just didn't love the narrator of the audiobook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-lido"&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/the-lido.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book was solidly fine. It's way too nostalgic, and heavy-handed
in prescribing the kind of society we should live in. If you love
reading articles about how millennials and cellphones are ruining
everything, this is a great book for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't. That said, the characters are endearing and the plot is
somewhat interesting. It's got a YA vibe in that every personality and
event is heavily simplified (in fact it's more YA than a lot of the YA
books I read...), and the whole book felt one-dimensional. But if
you're looking for an easy, mostly-uplifting read, this'll do the
trick :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="not-the-girls-you-re-looking-for"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35795940-not-the-girls-you-re-looking-for"&gt;Not the Girls You're Looking For&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/not-the-girls-youre-looking-for.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have mixed feelings about this one. It was more solidly YA than many
of the &amp;quot;YA&amp;quot; novels I read, and it reminded me of all the best and
worst parts of high school. Lulu is a biracial Arab-American Muslim teen
(her mom is a white American Catholic, her dad an Iraqi Muslim) living
in Texas, and it was interesting (and heartbreaking) to read about her
experiences of racism and struggle with her own cultural identity. She
has a wonderful and dramatic group of friends who have their own
struggles - one Hispanic, one lesbian, one with helicopter parents -
and while their fights felt petty they were also realistically high
school. I love the perspective this book gave me and the complexity of
the characters, if not the complexity of their boy problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tell-me-three-things"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25893582-tell-me-three-things"&gt;Tell Me Three Things&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/tell-me-three-things.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another true YA read, this had a similar vibe to the previous one -
heavy on the boy troubles, but also on the well-written characters
with interesting struggles. 'Tell Me Three Things' follows Jessie after
her mom dies, and her dad moves her from Chicago to LA to live with
his new wife (about 2 years after her mom dies). While the plot itself
is predictable Jessie's grief and coping with the loss of her mom is
palpable, and every character is dynamic and well-written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="calling-me-home"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15793184-calling-me-home"&gt;Calling Me Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/calling-me-home.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I LOVED this book. After a lot of so-so books it's so refreshing to
read a book that reminds you why you love to read. The book starts in
modern day when 90-something Isabelle asks her close friend and hair
dresser Dorrie to drive her to a funeral in Cincinnati from their home
in east Texas. Isabelle tells Dorrie about falling in love with a black
man in 1939 in Kentucky, in parallel talking about Dorrie's own modern
life as a black single mom raising 2 kids and dating. The characters
were so rich in this book, and before I knew it I felt so invested in
knowing what would happen next. I laughed, I cried, I gained so much
appreciation for the privilege I have as a white woman living in
modern day. My first 5-star in a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-dirty-book-club"&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/dirty-book-club.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was some lovely lighter fare while I travelled to Budapest for
work. It follows four women who, through a hilarious and unlikely
series of events, find themselves in a book club together despite
knowing very little about each other. From there the real antics
start: accidental affairs (the affair part is accidental, not the
sex), a bathtub falling through the ceiling, party favor vibrators,
and a big secret. I liked the complex female friendships in this - how
the 4 don't always get along but find that their lives are better
together than apart, and how in the end they're there for each other.
This is a fun and exciting beach read!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the first collection of Nora Ephron essays I read, and while
it was fine it didn't live up to my expectations. My favorite movie
while growing up was 'When Harry Met Sally', and as a young woman
trying to understand my own femininity and place in the world I
thought Ephron would be perfect for me. Instead her essays felt dated
and boring - I found I didn't connect much with her magazine habits
and beauty trend adventures. I wasn't completely turned off, and can
see the great writer beneath the fluffy topics. She's sharp and
confident, and able to describe the things you know intimately but
could never quite find the right words for. As you'll see this didn't
turn me off of Ephron altogether, but it's not what I'd recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is the Nora Ephron I expected. While still a collection of
essays this set was much more reflective and autobiographical. Ephron
discusses everything from beauty standards to food trends to finding
an apartment in New York, and while her references and tone felt dated
I loved reading about a passionate, working mom who wasn't victimizing
or complaining, but observing and appreciating (but also without being
goody-goody? I think only people from New York can pull this off).
I feel like I'm describing it very well, so I'll just say: if you like
WHMS, give this one a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Author's Note&lt;/em&gt;: I've also got Ephron's &amp;quot;I Remember Nothing&amp;quot; in my

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very overrated. I had high hopes for this one - I thought it'd be a
mystery for us library lovers, a thrilling profile of the man who set
the Los Angeles Central Library on fire and why, as well as a love
letter to libraries themselves. It was both those things yet was
&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; unsatisfying. I found Harry Peak was not an interesting or
compelling villain, and that gushing about libraries was more like trying
to convince me libraries were great. I kept thinking &amp;quot;I already agree
with you &lt;em&gt;where do you think I got this book?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;. Don't believe the
hype - listen to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.myfavoritemurder.com"&gt;My Favorite Murder&lt;/a&gt; instead, or show your support
for libraries by getting a different book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodness gracious I had a severe case of overhype this April. Maybe
it's me, or maybe there just weren't that many new books to gush
about....regardless, I thought this was the worst of the overhyped
reads, and perhaps also the most hyped. Everyone is talking about
Sally Rooney, and I &lt;em&gt;do not get it&lt;/em&gt;. Her characters are moody and
don't make sense, their interactions are brief and tense. The book
felt grey and depressing, the novel equivalent of a mid-January day. I
suppose that's the appeal, but it's not for me. I'd see the movie if
they made it with Saoirse Ronan, but besides that I think this is it
for me and Rooney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I liked most about this book was how it snuck up on you.
Throughout the book Queenie finds herself in increasingly terrible
situations, and often centering on her being an overweight black woman
in the UK. It begins with a breakup with her loving boyfriend, and
spirals from there to getting raped (and not feeling like she could
say no to a man she was flirting with) to having a miscarriage and
losing her job. Told from her perspective though the reader
understands every decision she makes. This book helped me understand
what it's like to be a woman of color, and how the things we judge
people for (how could you have a miscarriage and not know the father?)
are in reality nuanced stories and could easily have happened to us. I
loved that Queenie never felt sorry for herself, yet how she called
out racist and sexist policy and behavior when she saw it. This book
changed how I see the world and understand blackness in the UK/US -
can't recommend highly enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life changer alert: this book has &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; changed my life. It's
not an earth-shattering, ground-breaking kind of book but
definitely the right book read at the right time. As Eli and I
move back to Portland we've been thinking about how to 'shape' our
lives there. This book focuses on the design of cities and how city
planners can help make their residents happier, but throughout are
things residents can do to make their cities and communities happier.
Reading this really drove home that Eli and I don't want to own a car
(see what I did there?) and that we should structure our lives in
Portland around not owning one. It got us thinking about how we spend
our time and our money, what things are important to us, and what our
goals are (not suburbia!). On top of all that, the book was
well-researched and well-written, and held my interest the whole time.
Highly, highly recommend (especially if you're moving or have another
big change ahead in your life!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not usually one for sad books, particularly at such a stressful
time in my life. This one captivated me though, and the first-person
descriptions of having multiple sclerosis were vivid and haunting. I
loved the main character's voice and perspective - the everyday battle
against her own body, and not wanting to be a victim but still needing
help. Her narrative gave me empathy for people with MS and other
illnesses, and helped me see that people aren't defined by their
illness or disabilities. I also loved the narrators disorientation,
and thought the first-person perspective of fear and helplessness
(even when it wasn't due to her MS!) was visceral. This was also a
great audiobook! A tough topic, but 100% worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="george-and-lizzie"&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/george-and-lizzie.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book didn't really come together for me until the end. It was
pretty ho-hum, a perfect slightly-boring antidote to my
crazy-hectic-moving-to-Portland life at the moment, but nothing to
write home about. It's a slow burn, but all the low-lying conflict in
the book builds to a crescendo at the very end that makes the
characters and this long-winded story rewarding. It shows the
complexity and variability of relationships over time well. It's about
coming to terms with your past in order to be happy now, and about
living in the Midwest, and about what it means to have a happy
marriage. I thought this would be another disappointment on my list,
but by the end I was riveted! Tentatively recommend, if you can make
it 5/6ths through a boring read.&lt;/p&gt;

wouldn't get through all the books I did try for as many as I could
that were available at the library. This resulted in a slow month with
a lot of 'vegetable reads' - novels that I think are good for me, as I
wouldn't normally read them and they broaden my horizons. It was also
a great reminder of why I don't read books strictly based on acclaim
very often. A few gems were found though: let's get into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="warlight"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36723246-warlight"&gt;Warlight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Michael Ondaatje&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/warlight.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't usually the type of book I'd pick up, and honestly
reminded me why I don't read 'artsy' books as much. While I can see
the appeal of Ondaatje's ethereal settings, elusive characters, and
vivid setting descriptions, it's weird to dedicate so many words to
the strange details of a story (the dog race scene? What?) instead of
the plot or characters. I suppose that's the appeal - it just isn't
for me. Ultimately a good book, and good to get out of my comfort
zone, but I won't be coming back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="census"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068746-census"&gt;Census&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesse Ball&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/census.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ha! And I thought 'Warlight' was artsy. 'Census' was way too abstract
for a casual reader such as myself. While I wouldn't say this was a
'bad' book, and the Author's Note provided some much-needed and heart
wrenching context, it was not for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-italian-teacher"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31937362-the-italian-teacher"&gt;The Italian Teacher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/italian-teacher.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was by far my favorite of the ToB reads. I loved Pinch's
complicated relationship with both of his parents, and how that shaped
so much of his life. It captured so well how desperate we are to be
shown love by our parents, who are supposed to love us
unconditionally. How despite being rejected and ignored and
unsupported repeatedly by his father, Pinch still longs for his
acceptance even at the cost of success in other areas of his life. I
loved how messy Pinch's life was, how each event made sense on it's
own but together created a story that felt unlikely and wild. If you
like stories about family dynamics, coming of age, or the art world,
this one is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="surprise-me"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2770407672"&gt;Surprise Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/surprise-me.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was (appropriately) surprised by how much I liked this book! I
expected it to be a meaningless fling of a book, the kind of thing you
read when there's nothing else to read. The depth of the heroine's
character, the plot twists and gut wrenches in her story, and the
relatable setting all made this a very enjoyable read! I wouldn't go
so far as to say I loved it, or it changed my life or anything. I'm
not even sure I'd recommend it. But I would definitely not discourage
people from reading it, and hope you'll also find it entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a lady software engineer, I thought a romance novel with this title
could not disappoint. Apparently I learned nothing from 'Big Bang
Theory': tech-themed media is &lt;em&gt;so hard&lt;/em&gt; to get right. While the
technical details of the book are pretty good, the characters fall
totally flat. The heroine gives all appearance of being a 'strong
female lead', then ends up falling for a guy who's clearly beneath
her? I didn't really get it - Jeremy was a mostly-loser, and she could
have done &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; better. Skip this sorry feminist-wannabe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last of my ToB reads, I think it's most telling that my library
loan expired halfway through reading this and I didn't renew it.
Like 'Census' it wasn't a &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; book (will I ever say a book is a bad
book?), but I didn't feel invested in any of the characters. I didn't
understand the charm of the main hero, who hypnotizes an entire
community into doing his bidding, or the sense of loyalty the leading
lady felt for him. It was hard to care about what happened to anyone,
and - I can't believe I'm saying this - focused way too much on the
character dynamics and not enough on the plot. It was hard to
understand what was happening from such a narrow perspective, and I
admittedly can't read between the lines. Overall, this book was just a
bit confusing and not all that interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

was honestly just okay).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite some truly terrible reads, February was a wonderful month!
Well, mostly our &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.lucywyman.me/hawaii-2019.html"&gt;trip to Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; was wonderful. The rest of the
month was spent hoping it wouldn't snow then trapped inside by the
snow. I'm ready to move to LA. It's fine. Here are the few books I
actually made it through this month!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="royally-matched"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29991718-royally-matched"&gt;Royally Matched&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/royally-matched.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35271238-a-princess-in-theory"&gt;A Princess in Theory&lt;/a&gt; last month, this was a
disappointing return to typical romance novels. Based on the modern
royal family, the book was utterly predictable and I didn't love
either of the protagonists. Can't say I'd recommend it, but I didn't
have anything better to read and it was a quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="dietland"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22749796-dietland"&gt;Dietland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/dietland.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have really mixed feelings about this book. Having struggled with
anxiety about my body since I was a teenager I thought that a
body-positive read would be good for me. In some ways it was - it's a
fantastically feminist read about learning to love yourself and accept
yourself, including the gross, teary-eyed, hard struggle it takes to
get there. But when the feminism turns violent, and the
self-acceptance gets extreme, the books kind of lost me. I found it
emotional, and confusing, and wasn't sure whether I loved the message
or whether the message was that things can only change through
rejecting society and violence. It was definitely interesting food for
thought, and worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="laura-and-emma"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35297416-laura-emma"&gt;Laura and Emma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/laura-and-emma.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I powered through this after a drought of good books, and liked it
more by the end than I did in the beginning. It's about a single
mother raising her daughter in blue-blood New York City through the
80's and 90's, and was charming but not a &lt;em&gt;must read&lt;/em&gt;. I thought I
would identify with Laura and her progressive values more than I did,
and while she was empowering and self-reliant and imperfect, I didn't
feel compelled to know what happened to her. I liked Emma as a
character a lot more, and enjoyed how her personality changed as she
aged. Overall, I think this was a great book that just didn't resonate
with me as much as I wanted it to, but I think it may resonate with
others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-immortalists"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30288282-the-immortalists"&gt;The Immortalists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/the-immortalists.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FINALLY, in the last days of the month, I found a book to remind me
why I love to read. This novel opens in 1969 when 4 siblings visit a
fortune teller in their neighborhood, who is rumored to be able to
tell you the day you'll die. The rest of the book follows each of the
siblings, and how the prediction affects them and their lives. I loved
how different each of the siblings is, and their various takes on the
prediction. Each character is slightly romantic and very vivid - they
felt more like people you knew than characters in a book.  It's not
quite 5 stars, but I chewed through this thick book in 3 days and
can't recommend it enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know March is typically &amp;quot;In like a lion and out like a lamb&amp;quot;, but
spring came early for me and February's books were in like a lion and
out like a lamb. Hopefully this literary sunshine continues!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've got our big trip to Oahu coming up week-after-next (we fly out
February 12), and I think both of us are delirious with anticipation.
We've both started to feel burned out, and I know a week of doing
nothing in the sun will do us both good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month's literature had it's ups and downs. There wasn't anything
I &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt;, but then I think reading some just-ok books gives me an
appreciate for the gems. This post is long, so without further ado
here's what I read in January:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="eleanor-park"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15745753-eleanor-park"&gt;Eleanor &amp;amp; Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rainbow Rowell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/eleanor-and-park.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed this book for the same reasons I think many readers enjoy
it. I loved how real Eleanor and Park were - how they were truly
awkward teenagers, trying to figure life out, and how fast and deeply
they fell for each other. It brought back a lot of fond memories of my
high school years. I was captivated by their family dynamics, and
found it was &lt;cite&gt;moreish&lt;/cite&gt; - I wanted to keep reading every chance I
got to find out what would happen. Highly recommend if you're looking
for a modern love story, coming-of-age, and misfit teens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-last-mrs-parrish"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34043643-the-last-mrs-parrish"&gt;The Last Mrs. Parrish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liv Constantine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/the-last-mrs-parrish.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoiler alert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; enjoyed this book, though didn't quite love it. I wish
that the husband had died in the end - I definitely thought that's what
&amp;quot;The Last&amp;quot; part of the title was. But I enjoyed reading about strong
women taking down a horrible man. I thought Amber and Daphne were
both well-written, layered, mostly sympathetic characters, and the
changing perspective in the story was &lt;em&gt;fantastic&lt;/em&gt;. I totally didn't
see it coming! And then I was HOOKED. Not quite 'Gone Girl' level, but
an exciting thriller with lady leads.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="south-and-west"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32842454-south-and-west"&gt;South and West&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/south-and-west.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first Joan Didion experience, and while I found the
subject revolting I thought her style of writing was some of the best
I've ever read. The way she's able to step outside of the time and
place she's describing and include details that at the time must have
seemed insignificant but which, reading it now, stand out and give so
much color and depth to her travels! Her language is rich, her
attention to detail is limitless, and her perspective is funny and
real and honest. I continue to &lt;em&gt;loathe&lt;/em&gt; the deep south and everything
it stands for, but fell in love with Joan Didion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reread this for the first time since reading it as a tween, and
loved it just as much. It's so sweet and nostalgic in the way reading
YA is, and I the moral of answering the question of 'why things die'
really resonated with me. I'm among those that thinks on my mortality
often, and I always worry that I'm not making the most of my life.
&amp;quot;Tuck Everlasting&amp;quot; reminded me that to have unlimited time would be
even worse, and that death can be both scary and a natural part of
human life. It made the prospect of dying less terrifying, and told a
lovely story along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/a-place-for-us.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book wasn't for me - I don't think because it was a bad book, but
because it was &lt;em&gt;so boring&lt;/em&gt;. I made it halfway through before giving up
for greener pastures. I found I just didn't care at all about any of
the characters, and was only occasionally enraged at the injustice of
the gender norms. I think writing in third-person is hard like that -
while I appreciated the switching perspective, and stories from each
character, I never felt like I knew any of the characters.  The
timeline is difficult to keep track of, and there's just no depth to
anyone in the story. I just couldn't muddle through such a big book
of nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-red-car"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34082140-the-red-car"&gt;The Red Car&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/the-red-car.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised by how much I liked this novel, both while reading it
and on reflection. I think it was exactly what I needed at this time
in my life. It's about reflecting on your life so far, trying to
figure out what you really want, and letting life just tumble you
along instead of trying to control it for a time. I loved the dreamy
quality of the book, and how the author writes each of the main
characters thoughts out in such a realistic way, like how she keeps
forgetting then re-realizing that she took time off of work. That's SO
MUCH how I think, and I've never read that idiosyncrasy captured in a
character so well. I liked the mystery of the car, and that it was
never really solved. I honestly kind of liked that there wasn't a lot
of resolution. It felt very California, very outside of time and
place, very akin to how the character felt in their life. I wouldn't
call this my favorite book of the year, but I'm surprised in
reflecting on it how much I enjoyed living in Leah's head for a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/early-work.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I almost forgot to include this in the monthly update, which I think
sums up pretty well what I thought of it. This was the most mediocre
book ever. I wouldn't even say it was &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; - there was nothing to
dislike about it because there was nothing to think about it. Some
writer who is SO full of himself treats people around him like
garbage, and gets away with it, and everyone acts like it's normal as
always happens. The girlfriends both take it in stride and continue
living their way more interesting and successful lives, dragging him
along for god knows why reason. He's not even philosophical, or
creative, or interesting. He's a mashed potato sandwich dipped in the
hot sauce of casual misogyny. Actually, now that I'm writing about it,
maybe I &lt;em&gt;didn't&lt;/em&gt; like this book, and just kept reading for the dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/truth-and-beauty.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ann Patchett's descriptions are unparalleled. She paints such a vivid
picture of her friend, describing her physicality and interactions so
well you start to think you know Lucy. Her re-telling is wonderful in
how she's able to remember what it was like to experience the story at
the time, as well as in retrospect. I remember her describing 9/11,
and saying &amp;quot;At the time that's how we thought of them: missing&amp;quot;. That
kind of perspective is so hard to cultivate, and she does it
seamlessly. This is a beautiful and heart-breaking story of
friendship, and it's trials and tribulations and rewards and
adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month was mostly meh, with several books that were enjoyable
enough to see through but that I wouldn't necessarily recommend. I
&lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;Eleanor Oliphant&amp;quot;, despite having put it down halfway through
6 months ago, but other than that I can't honestly rave about any of
my other reads. So, I suppose this is a list for is you have
absolutely nothing better to read. HAHAHA as if that ever happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's to starting off the new year with better books!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="eleanor-oliphant-is-completely-fine"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31434883-eleanor-oliphant-is-completely-fine"&gt;Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gail Honeyman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/eleanor-oliphant-is-completely-fine.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely my favorite read this month, I put &amp;quot;Eleanor Oliphant&amp;quot; down
last May, deciding I didn't care for the protagonist or plot. If only
I had read 50 more pages! I won't give away any spoilers, but will
only say that you should power through at least 1/2 the book before
giving up on it. More is revealed about Eleanor that makes her a much
more palatable character, and by the end you'll be literally crying
for her. At first it seems like a book about a stuck-up loner with a
horrible mother, but later you'll find themes of loneliness,
judgement, depression, and trauma. A must read!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="if-you-come-softly"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36076595-if-you-come-softly"&gt;If You Come Softly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jacqueline Woodson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/if-you-come-softly.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read this as part of John Green's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.lifeslibrarybookclub.com/"&gt;Life's Library&lt;/a&gt; project, and
have mixed feelings. It's short enough that I'd consider worth the
investment of time and energy, and I wholeheartedly understand and
endorse it's status as an important book which has remained remarkably
relevant for 20 years now. I may not have liked it, but it was a good
book for me to read and reflect on. I also liked that the focus wasn't
&lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; about race, but that both characters were complex and layered,
and race was just one part of their multi-faceted identity. I know the
book is based on &amp;quot;Romeo and Juliet&amp;quot;, but it was a little hard to get
over the love-at-first-sight thing, and felt the use of poetry was
heavy-handed. It made the book unnecessarily angsty, and distracted
from the prose. Lastly I &lt;em&gt;hated&lt;/em&gt; the end. I'll try not to spoil it
here, but it felt like an attempt to &amp;quot;save&amp;quot; the book or give it more
meaning than it could have otherwise. While realistic, it felt like a
way of avoiding writing more character development, and actually
following through on the protagonists relationship. Ok, dangerously
close to spoilers, so that's all I'll say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="late-bloomers-club"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36952311-the-late-bloomers-club"&gt;Late Bloomers' Club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/late-bloomers-club.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some words to describe this book:
Fine
Cute
Relaxing
Forgettable
Shrug&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-princess-in-theory"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35271238-a-princess-in-theory"&gt;A Princess in Theory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alyssa Cole&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/a-princess-in-theory.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was nearly the perfect romance novel. The smart, capable heroine!
The sensitive, supportive hero! SHE PEES AFTER SEX TO AVOID A UTI! I
really enjoyed this book - the plot was interesting and exciting, the
characters were endearing, and it addressed social issues particularly
around sex head on. The perfect modern romance, if you ask me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="sisterland"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16099180-sisterland"&gt;Sisterland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/sisterland.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I wouldn't recommend this book. I made it to the end, and it
was good enough that I wanted to know what happened, but there's much
better literature and characters out there (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25852870-eligible"&gt;Eligible&lt;/a&gt; by the same
author being a good example!). My main complaint is that the narrator
doesn't abide by a set of principles, and while I think there's a
place for flawed narrators and protagonists this one was &lt;em&gt;so annoying&lt;/em&gt;
and spineless. She doesn't take her family's best interests into
account, and reveals herself to be selfish and weirdly obstinate on
certain issues while flexible on others. I was too far in by the time
all this happened to put the book down, but I honestly have no
sympathy for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="shakespeare-the-world-as-stage"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/135611.Shakespeare"&gt;Shakespeare: The World as Stage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bill Bryson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/shakespeare.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read this before giving to my dad as a Christmas present, and was
surprised and delighted by how entertaining it was. It attempts to
examine Shakespeare's life, but because so little is known about him
ends up being more about the time-period and context he lived in. I
don't generally care for history, but thought this was fascinating and
at time hilarious. Who knew the Puritans living in Elizabethan England
were so wily? Or that a rival theater group literally &lt;em&gt;stole a
theater&lt;/em&gt; and rebuilt the building on the other side of the river?
Highly recommend this short and fun read!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Groff, an author I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; I don't enjoy yet insist on giving a new
chance every few months. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36344555-all-we-ever-wanted"&gt;All We Ever Wanted&lt;/a&gt; by Emily Giffin, which
sounded interesting but just felt like too much after hearing so much
about the election. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40961230-the-travelling-cat-chronicles"&gt;The Travelling Cat Chronicles&lt;/a&gt; by Hiro Arikawa,
which just wasn't my cup of tea. A lot of half-read and unopened
novels on the shelf this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But! It was a fantastic month besides. I helped run a tech conference
early in the month, and got to spend time with wonderful people whom I
don't see enough of. Thanksgiving was perfect; my parents joined Eli's
family for the big meal, and it was the best weekend of relaxation,
food, good company, laughter, and joy that I can remember having in a
while. And through it all, here's what I was reading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="you-me-everything"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36077170-you-me-everything"&gt;You, Me, Everything&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like I should have liked this book more than I did. There's
nothing about it I &lt;em&gt;didn't&lt;/em&gt; like - I enjoyed the main characters, felt
like they developed and changed in interesting ways, and the
information reveals throughout kept me reading. It just fell a little
flat, for whatever reason, and was more sad than I was anticipating
(in a good way!). &lt;em&gt;Shrug&lt;/em&gt;. I hope they make it into a movie, because
it's set in the South of France and I think would be visually
&lt;em&gt;stunning&lt;/em&gt; and emotional in real life rather than a novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved this book! I found each character's story so compelling, of
course loved the strong cultural and feminist tones, and thought the
mystery kept things interesting and timely. This was very nearly a
perfect Lucy book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one might not be for everyone, but I've recently taken an
interest in wordplay and enjoyed the wit and humor in this book. It
is, of course, full of puns and approaches the subject of wordplay and
language development with curiosity and whimsy. But it also details a
(euro-centric) history of how wordplay was culturally perceived, and
important moments and characters in the development of the pun. A
great gift for the english major in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides 'little one' being THE WORST pet name in the history of
romance novels, this is a pretty good romantic read. It's not a
hate-to-love trope, which already puts it in like the top 10% of
romance novels. And on top of that there are interesting and very
realistic conflicts around relationships amid fame, and romance with your
brothers friend. This was a layered read that was really more a great
rom-com with steamy sex scenes. As long as you can get past 'little
one', which I would understand if you couldn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-proposal"&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/the-proposal.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another book I thought I would like more than I did. Diverse
characters, a strong, sassy, independent female lead with an equally
strong-willed and compassionate male lead. The conflicts were totally
believable, the story was cute and compelling. All the elements are
there! I'm not sure why I wasn't head-over-heels for this modern
romance, but for whatever reason it was just ok for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick aside: did anyone else follow the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.pbs.org/the-great-american-read/home/"&gt;Great American Read&lt;/a&gt; series
by PBS? I loved the diversity of their list of 100 books, and while I
was disappointed that Harry Potter didn't 'win' it was a fun series to
follow along with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what I couldn't put down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="sadie"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll admit I'm not the most perceptive consumer when it comes to
mysteries and thrillers. I &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; see the twist coming, and am putty
in the hands of the author / director. 'Sadie' was no exception, and I
&lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; this YA thriller. The main character, Sadie, was amazingly
layered and unique, and I loved reading the story through her voice.
Her narration is also juxtaposed with a journalist telling the story,
and I appreciated that it didn't feel like the 'storytelling within
storytelling' crutch was used too much. His narration felt genuine,
and gave you both a new perspective on the story and little dribbles
of new information along the way. I was so wrapped up in hearing the
end, I literally got to work 20 minutes late this morning because I
&lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to finish it. Highly highly recommend!&lt;/p&gt;

John Green's books growing up. As such there was a lot of hype around
Hank publishing a book, and I was excited not just to read the book as
a book but to read something that someone I kind of care about in a
celebrity type way wrote. It felt more personal somehow than just
reading any-old book. I don't know why I didn't expect the book to be
great, but I didn't, and &lt;em&gt;hot dog&lt;/em&gt; was I impressed. Hank's debut novel
is amazing. I love his protagonist and narrator, April May, who is
layered and human and flawed but very likeable. I loved the commentary
on fame, and how fame changes you and what the experience of fame is
like. I loved the whimsy of the sci-fi / mystery robot plot. I loved
the voice of the novel, the funny throw-away lines and how unique each
characters way of thinking was. I can't recommend this book highly
enough, whether you're 13 or 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="where-d-you-go-bernadette"&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/whered-you-go-bernadette.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I liked this better than Maria Semple's previous books, I
wouldn't say you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to read it. It's a sweet story about a
dysfunctional family (who live in Seattle - it was so fun to recognize
all the place names!) and the crazy antics and adventures the family
finds themselves in. It's being turned into a movie, and while I can't
say I resonate well with the characters I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think this will look
great on screen. It was a fun read, and could be a fun film - that
alone makes it worth reading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="from-the-corner-of-the-oval"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36758503-from-the-corner-of-the-oval"&gt;From the Corner of the Oval&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/from-the-corner-of-the-oval.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was pleasantly surprised by this book - not because I thought it
would be bad, but because I thought it would be different. Rather than
focusing on the political insight and intrigue of working directly
with the President, 'From the Corner of the Oval' focuses much more on
Beck's personal life, as well as her incredible experiences as part of
White House staff. It reads more like a memoir than an episode of the
West Wing, and while some may find this disappointing I read &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt;
of myself in Beck's story. I loved hearing her struggle to find a
sense of identity, to earn respect in a tough job, and to find meaning
in her work. She's a talented writer with a fascinating story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="hyperfocus"&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/hyperfocus.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was expecting this to be a kind-of-dumb self-help book, telling me I
wasn't disciplined enough or whatever and that if I was just &lt;em&gt;more
focused&lt;/em&gt; then I could focus better. It's actually a great, data-driven
book that includes exercises for improving focus and the science
behind them. The author is also humble and grounded - he doesn't claim
to have all the answers, or that every exercise will 'cure' you
somehow. He encourages the reader to try each exercise and use the
ones that work best for them. He also emphasizes that any lack of
focus isn't your 'fault', or even a 'bad' thing, but that it is
something you may want to have more control over than you currently
do. I found the book effective in giving me strategies to focus on a
task for longer, to be more present in my life, and altogether a very
pleasant read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-coincidence-of-coconut-cake"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25650078-the-coincidence-of-coconut-cake"&gt;The Coincidence of Coconut Cake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/coincidence-of-coconut-cake.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to this audiobook &lt;em&gt;in it's entirety&lt;/em&gt; on a round-trip drive
to Portland, and it was &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; for that trip. It's one of those
candy reads that provides lots of room for imagination, and is sweet
and satisfying. I liked that the characters felt real and believable
(definitely not a given in the romance novel genre), and I loved the
food theme. The heroine was strong and independent, the hero flawed
but loveable. It was more chaste than I was expecting, and more of a
rom-com book than a proper romance novel. A quick and easy read, if
you find yourself between better books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

lot for the past month - a blessing and a curse - which has meant I
get to see a lot of wonderful humans I care for and don't see very
often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've unknowingly been on a books-by-women-about-women kick
this summer - I didn't even notice until scrolling through my library
history. And honestly I'm really into it. This has been a pretty good
run of high-quality reads, most of them the right balance of fun and
meaningful. I've talked before about &amp;quot;vegetable books&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;candy
books&amp;quot;, but I think many of these reads can probably be called &amp;quot;fruit
books&amp;quot;: sweet, and secretly good for you. And often brightly colored
on the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="when-katie-met-cassidy"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31684565-when-katie-met-cassidy"&gt;When Katie Met Cassidy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Camille Perri&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/when-katie-met-cassidy.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I fell in love with both of the heroines in this book. They're
such rich, complex, layered characters I felt like I knew them in real
life. Camille Perri is a master at describing emotional responses,
details in interactions, and wardrobes, in a way that paints such a
complete picture of Katie and Cassidy's relationship. I loved how she
bent gendered stereotypes so effortlessly: of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; Katie was going
to fall for Cassidy, of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; they were meant to be together. A
fantastic modern love story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it possible for there to be a hilarious book about cancer? Well, if
it is, I can't imagine it gets better than &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36373380-the-bucket-list"&gt;The Bucket List&lt;/a&gt;. The
protagonist is a sarcastic young woman who so closely mirrors my own
struggle with balancing work and feminism and life and womanhood it's
like reading my diary. What I love about this book is the voice and
style of the character, the way she's not just contending with having
the BRCA 1 gene mutation but also &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt; as a 20-something in New
York. Highly, highly recommended reading for the right mix of fun and
thought-provoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know everyone is already buzzing about &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15749186-to-all-the-boys-i-ve-loved-before"&gt;To All the Boys I've Loved
Before&lt;/a&gt; since Netflix made it &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80203147"&gt;a movie&lt;/a&gt;, but I'm here to throw in
another &amp;quot;You should read this!&amp;quot;.  It's more YA than fiction or
romance, but is so sweet and (for a 23 year old like me) nostalgic.
It's a wonderful teenage romance, with all the angst and drama and
heightened emotions you'd expect but without the jerky boys and
vampires. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.gq.com/story/horny-for-wholesome"&gt;This GQ article&lt;/a&gt; sums it up: &amp;quot;At last, with the help of
Netflix, we have our new type: the wholesome man.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know anything about the &lt;a class="reference internal" href="#financial-independence-retire-early-fire"&gt;financial independence / retire early
(FIRE)&lt;/a&gt; community, it's probably &lt;a class="reference internal" href="#mr-money-mustache"&gt;Mr. Money Mustache&lt;/a&gt;. And if you
read MMM, you're probably either 1. A bro who identifies strongly with
him and who loves to brag to your friends about how you haven't eaten at a
restaurant for 3 years or 2. A normal person who was intimidated away
from the notion of saving for retirement. But it doesn't have to be
this way! &lt;a class="reference internal" href="#frugalwoods"&gt;Frugalwoods&lt;/a&gt; is a fantastic FIRE blog written by the
eloquent and sensible Elizabeth Willard Thames, where she prescribes a
more balanced and kind approach to frugality. I love that Elizabeth
acknowledges the privilege inherent in elective frugality, that she
preaches spending based on your &lt;em&gt;values&lt;/em&gt; not on miserly living, and
that she is never judgemental or condescending. I love her blog, and
her book is really just a consolidated and long version of that. I
highly highly highly recommend either, whichever suits your fancy, no
matter where your finances are or what your goals are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/eat-pray-love.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reread for the third or fourth time, Elizabeth Gilbert's writing is my
comfort food. Her writing style is so warm and expressive, filled with
delicious metaphors and rich descriptions. It's like seeing the world
with entirely new eyes, and inspires me to look closer at myself and
my environment. I love all her memoirish books - &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6728738-committed"&gt;Committed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24453082-big-magic"&gt;Big
Magic&lt;/a&gt; are equally wonderful and revelatory - and love coming back to
them at different points throughout my life. A book is never the same
when you come back to it, and each time I notice a new passage or
insight that I somehow missed the first 4 times through. Rather than
recommending you read EPL, though, I recommend picking up a favorite
read from a few years ago. What book do you keep coming back to, or
take comfort in reading?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-fall-of-marigolds"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18114142-a-fall-of-marigolds"&gt;A Fall of Marigolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/a-fall-of-marigolds.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be honest, this book didn't resonate with me that much. I found
one of the main characters - who narrates most of the book - to be
wishy-washy and limp. I didn't like her, though perhaps I wasn't
supposed to like her? Regardless the book was at least good enough to
finish, seemed to resonate with many other people, and while I didn't
&lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; the characters it was well-written and clever. If you like
historical fiction, or stories set in New York, this is for you!&lt;/p&gt;

still in the dog days of summer, soaking in the sunshine and trying to
ignore the back-to-school ads even though we're not technically on
summer break anymore. My summer has been busy in the best possible
way, and I feel like I've made the most of every moment. There've been
barbecues, berry-picking, hikes, a wedding, movies, ice cream,
farmers markets, and of course so much time with friends and family.
And books! Here's what I've been enjoying lately:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-curious-charms-of-arthur-pepper"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26722820-the-curious-charms-of-arthur-pepper"&gt;The Curious Charms of Arthur Pepper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phaedra Patrick&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/charms-of-arthur-pepper.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the sweetest book! With great character development and a
charming story, this book surprised me with it's depth of plot and mix
of eccentric and realistic events. It handled real issues of aging,
life after the loss of a loved one, and finding meaning in life, while
also including a scene about a man who only wear electric blue and
owns several tigers. Definitely the feel-good story of the summer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="when-life-gives-you-lululemons"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36373647-when-life-gives-you-lululemons"&gt;When Life Gives You Lululemons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lauren Weisberger&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/life-gives-you-lululemons.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know &lt;em&gt;The Devil Wears Prada&lt;/em&gt; is a series?? Me neither. This is
the third installment, which I didn't even realize until I looked at
the goodreads page after finishing it. You definitely don't need to
have read the 2nd one to understand this one, and if you like DWP you
will love &lt;em&gt;When Life Gives You Lululemons&lt;/em&gt;! It's funny, relatable,
heartbreaking, and in the end victorious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="save-the-date"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="#save-the-date"&gt;Save the Date&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mary Kay Andrews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/save-the-date.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cute enough romance story. I'm honestly not a huge fan of the
love-to-hate trope, but did love that the female lead was a business
owner and in the end grew to like both characters. Not my first
recommendation, but a quick candy read if your romance novel TBR list
has dried up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-handmaid-s-tale"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="#the-handmaid-s-tale"&gt;The Handmaid's Tale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Margaret Atwood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/handmaids-tale.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be honest: I really didn't like this book. But I still think you
should read it. Since I can't handle watching the show, reading the
book is the next best way to be able to talk to other people about
the story and to understand the nuances of how it's used in everyday
conversation. This book is definitely part of our modern zeitgeist,
and as painful as oflgen's lack of character development and action
is, and as painful as Atwood's over-the-top grandiose writing style
is, there's a lot to unpack and discuss. Get through it, then be like
me and tell everyone all the things you didn't like about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

actually be a bit of a strong word for these books -- maybe fun is

upcoming summer months, with it's beach trips, long drives, airplane
rides, and lazy Sundays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-dry"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Dry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jane Harper&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the book all your Liane-Moriarty-fan friends are going to be
talking about this summer. Set in a rural Australian town, a father,
mother, and son are found dead on their farm leaving only their baby
daughter alive. Initially suspected to be a murder-suicide by the
father figure,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="when-rishi-met-dimple"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sandhya Menon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a tremendously enjoyable YA novel; candy read to the max. I
loved both protagonists, and appreciated what layered and well-rounded
characters they were. Their 'issues' felt very realistic, and the
events of the book didn't feel as contrived as romance and especially
YA romance can often feel. I also of course loved the technical
setting of the book, and a strong female lead. Highly recommended easy
reading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pachinko"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Min Jin Lee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read this for a book club, and since there were approximately 1
million holds on the audio book and e-book at the Library, I ended up
picking up the physical hard-cover copy of it. This is the first
physical book I've read at least since college, probably since high
school, and I'll admit I was a little worried I had forgotten how to
read physical books. But not so! I surprised myself by reading this
600 page book in just 5 days, and was &lt;em&gt;riveted&lt;/em&gt;. I didn't expect I
would like the book itself, much less in book-form, but found myself
reading it every chance I got. I loved the focus on characters and not
events, the way that despite triumphs and tragedies life continues to
go on, and the way we see social changes reflected in the characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another candy read ðŸ™ƒ  but that's what summer is for, right?? I loved
this royal wedding fan-fic, and while the royal wedding has passed us
by (cries) we can still read about royal wedding drama right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ann Brashares&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A classic! I re-read this recently (in one day, no less) to celebrate
the arrival of summer, and was surprised by how well it stood the test
of time and aging.  Perhaps part of my love is for the nostalgia of
reading it when I was growing up, but I fell right back in love with
the 4 heroines and their friendship. We don't write about female
friendship enough, and these ladies are truly inspiring! More like
this please thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

because I had a rather unlucky streak of uninspiring books. It wasn't
that these were &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; books, but they just weren't the type of books
that felt worth sharing. &lt;cite&gt;The Commitment&lt;/cite&gt; by Dan Savage is the perfect
example: while I enjoy Savage's writing, this was a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; book where
Savage tries to convince the (presumably liberal) reader that same-sex
marriage should be legal. Either you agree with him and gain nothing
from the book, or you disagree with him and only make it 2 pages in.
I didn't regret reading it, but definitely didn't think it was worth
writing about. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25810091-the-never-open-desert-diner"&gt;The Never-Open Desert Diner&lt;/a&gt; is another good example:
it was perfectly enjoyable but kind of weird and I don't know that I
would say I recommend it? It was pretty far outside of my typical
literary diet, and while it was great to step out of my comfort zone
I'd feel dishonest encouraging others to read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But! Things have turned around. I've read a number of great books over
the course of February and March, and have finally compiled enough to
warrant a post. I'm a few days past the 'Spring Reads' deadline, but
we'll call it Spring Reads anyway ;) Here's what I've been enjoying
lately:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-muse"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27213208-the-muse"&gt;The Muse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jessie Burton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book took me by surprise, and was such a delight! It's a clever
story with wonderfully complex characters, and who create great
tension and conflict with each other. It's so hard to write characters
who are all likeable and empathetic but still create believable
conflict, and Jessie Burton nailed it. A bit of a long one, but worth
every hour!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-grownup"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26025580-the-grownup"&gt;The Grownup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gillian Flynn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A half-step closer to horror than &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19288043-gone-girl"&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/a&gt;, this short story by
Gillian Flynn proves &amp;quot;Gone Girl&amp;quot; was no fluke. It's impossible to tell
what's true, who's lying, and what really happened. Strong female
lead, plot twists I never saw coming, and an open ending make this a
story that you'll keep thinking about long after putting it down.
Highly recommend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="lily-and-the-octopus"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27276262-lily-and-the-octopus"&gt;Lily and the Octopus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stephen Rowley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read this because it was the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://girlybookclub.com/"&gt;Girly Book Club's&lt;/a&gt; March read, and I
have mixed feelings about it. It's an unusual and heart-wrenching
read, but I didn't feel like it brought anything new to the
sad-book-about-a-dying-dog genre of books. The book follows Ted as he
grapples with the inevitable death of his beloved companion, a
dachshund named Lily. It was honestly hard to empathize with Ted, and
while there's no wrong way to grieve it was hard to be in the mind of
someone who is so lonely and who's only friend is a dying dog. At the
same time, it has rich descriptions, great characters, and is
excellent at making Lily a character as much as Ted. So...a mixed bag.
Read at your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="call-me-by-your-name"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/98687.Call_Me_by_Your_Name"&gt;Call Me By Your Name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AndrÃ© Aciman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my favorite book ever. Period. The best movie, and the best
book. Elio is so expressive and emotional. As I've gotten older I
think I've lost touch with that emotional side of myself, for better
or worse. Especially in America I think it's typical to numb yourself
in order to 'get through' everyday life, and we quickly forget what
it's like to feel much of anything very strongly. &amp;quot;Call Me By Your
Name&amp;quot; reminds me to not be afraid of feeling too much, to be
vulnerable and present and that even the lows have a certain richness
to them when you really &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; them. I love the setting, I love the
story, I love the characters. I want to live in the world and the
character that Aciman has created everyday, and am glad that for at
least a few hours this week I was able to escape to that place. This
is definitely a read that I'll keep coming back to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Reflect on them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've been meaning to read more but aren't sure how to get started, or
aren't satisfied with your current reading process, this post is for you!
Some parts of the process I've been doing for years, others are parts that I'm
actively working to do more diligently and improve at. Let's dive in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="finding-books-to-read"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finding Books to Read&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this isn't a very universal or sustainable way of finding books
to read, but I honestly just go to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://powells.com"&gt;Powell's&lt;/a&gt; books in Portland, OR and see
what's on their shelves that looks interesting. They have a wide selection of
new books, sprinkled with classics and a-few-years-ago best-sellers, and
wandering their aisles + checking the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://powells.com/staff-picks"&gt;new and recommended&lt;/a&gt; list provides me
with plenty of reading suggestions! One caveat: this definitely involves
judging books by their covers, and I'm not ashamed of it. I honestly like
reading books that I know nothing about because it avoids coloring my
experience with expectations, and much like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem"&gt;the halting problem&lt;/a&gt; you can't know if
you'll like a book until you've read it anyway. So, a cover seems a fine thing
to judge it by. I also occasionally will have books recommended through blogs I
read, people I talk to, or just general gossip, but for the most part I find
books through Powell's. If you're not in Portland, I highly recommend finding a
local book store and doing the same!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="acquiring-books"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Acquiring Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the rare exception of cookbooks or books I want to take notes in, I get
all of my books from the library through &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://overdrive.com"&gt;Overdrive&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://meet.libbyapp.com"&gt;Libby&lt;/a&gt; is their new
app -- I haven't tried it yet, but have heard great things!). You can get
e-books (for kindle, or that you can read on your phone or laptop) or audio
books, and depending on the book they get new releases pretty quickly (e-books
faster than audio books). In general I'd say about 80% of the books I'm
interested in reading are available, and those that aren't I request from the
library and they tend to get there eventually. The library automatically checks
books out for you when they become available, and you have them for 3 weeks and
can renew them if you aren't finished, just like for the 'regular' books. I
love getting books this way because it's 1. Free, 2. Supports our local
library, and 3. Makes it super easy to listen to and read books. You can even
listen at faster or slower speeds, add bookmarks, and see the history of books
you've read. It's a &lt;em&gt;fantastic&lt;/em&gt; resource, and I can't recommend it highly
enough!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="reading"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a capital-m Millennial, I tend to prefer audiobooks to e-books so that I
can &amp;quot;read&amp;quot; while commuting, doing chores, running errands, and so on. After
discovering Overdrive about 3 years ago, I went from reading maybe 4 books a
year to reading at least one book each week, and it's completely changed my
life. While listening to books is definitely a different and less engaging
experience than reading them, I simply don't have the time to sit down and read
very often, and audiobooks have made the entire world of books available to me
in a way literature never was before. It's also had the side-effect of making
chores, commuting, and other boring activities things I actually look forward
to, as it's a chance to listen to a story and unwind from the day. Like food,
reading is a personal business, and you should do what works for you. But if
not having time to read is what's been holding you back from picking up a book,
I highly encourage you to give audiobooks a try!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="reflecting"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reflecting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the part I'm especially terrible at. I was pretty good about writing
short &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/tag/book-review.html"&gt;book reviews&lt;/a&gt; of the books I read for a while there, but fell off the
wagon and have never managed to get back on since. I know &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://goodreads.com"&gt;Goodreads&lt;/a&gt; is a
great resource for reflecting on books, and even better having discussions
about them, but I've also not been keeping up with that either. For now, my
reflection is mostly internal, but this is something I'm working to change!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's it! This process has worked for me for years, and I hope there's
some helpful hint here that will help you read more and enjoy what you read! If you're not sure which books to start with, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/category/books.html"&gt;here are some of my favorites&lt;/a&gt;. Happy reading!&lt;/p&gt;

finds you well! It's that time of year again: the leaves have, fallen, the
chill has set in, and the holidays are just over the horizon. I always find
myself reading more in the winter, when it's too cold to leave my apartment and
nothing sounds better than a mug of tea and a book. Whether you're travelling
to visit family, or have some cozy mornings in your future, here's what I can
recommend adding to your reading list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS I'm not a professional enough blogger to make commissions or
anything, but I do have a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/2016-book-gifting-guide.html"&gt;book-themed gift guide&lt;/a&gt; for all the readers
in your life. And we're all readers! Check it out if you're not sure
what to get someone. Ok, on with our regularly scheduled program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="too-fat-too-slutty-too-loud"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33257571-too-fat-too-slutty-too-loud"&gt;Too Fat, Too Slutty, Too Loud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Anne Helen Petersen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="static/too-fat-too-slutty-too-loud.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expected this book to be yet another ranty read about how oppressed women
are. While I think those books are important and read a lot of them, it's
draining to read about the systemic problems and rarely be presented with
solutions. &amp;quot;Too Fat, Too Slutty, Too Loud&amp;quot; absolutely blew me away though.
Petersen's writing is precise, intelligent, and clear, and I found myself
having 'Aha!' moments at least once per chapter. A great read for any feminist
(aka everyone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-music-got-free"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23398715-how-music-got-free"&gt;How Music Got Free&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Stephen Witt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="static/how-music-got-free.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another book I expected to be dull, but which turned out to be great! Rather
than laying out the facts in chronological order, &amp;quot;How Music Got Free&amp;quot; wove
together the stories from 3 people who contributed to the rise and fall of
the pirated music industry. It's an epic story, told more like a novel than a
non-fiction account. Thoroughly entertaining and interesting, whether you
like (and pirate) music or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tiny-beautiful-things"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13152194-tiny-beautiful-things"&gt;Tiny Beautiful Things&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Cheryl Strayed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="static/tiny-beautiful-things.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love everything Cheryl Strayed writes. If she wrote a phone book, I'd
probably read it. Her work is consistently thought provoking, concise,
beautiful, and profound, and &amp;quot;Tiny Beautiful Things&amp;quot; is quintessential Cheryl.
A compilation of advice columns, &amp;quot;Tiny Beautiful Things&amp;quot; is all about
understanding the human experience. Part poetry, part therapy, entirely worth
reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="commonwealth"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28214365-commonwealth"&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Ann Patchett&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="static/commonwealth.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book may not be for everyone, but as a reader who loves a good cast of
characters &amp;quot;Commonwealth&amp;quot; was right up my alley. The characters were rich and
realistic, and the plot follows the story of a blended family we know all to
well with an unexpected twist. An excellent low-stress read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="big-little-lies"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19486412-big-little-lies"&gt;Big Little Lies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Liane Moriarty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="static/big-little-lies.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know you already know this one, so let me just throw my recommendation in with all the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="turtles-all-the-way-down"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35504431-turtles-all-the-way-down"&gt;Turtles All the Way Down&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By John Green&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="static/turtles-all-the-way-down.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you're not a young adult, John Green's latest novel is a wonderful
and quick read. It's narrated by the protagonist, Aza Holmes, a young woman
trying to live with and manage obsessive-compulsive disorder while trying to
be a good daughter, good friend, and a good detective. What I loved about it
was that it helped me understand at least one person's experience of mental
illness, and helped humanize and sympathize disordered thinking for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kitchens of the Great Midwest is just about the sweetest book.
Following the life of Eva Thorvald through the eyes of those around her,
this book details the joys and pains of growing up in the midwest. Filled
with food and a kindness only midwesterners can muster, KotGM is the
perfect compliment to sunshine and lazy days in the park.&lt;/p&gt;

the Military Became Everything&lt;/a&gt; might be the best book I read all
year. The military has never been part of my family or culture, yet as
an American has tremendous impact on my life. A former Pentagon
reporter, Rosa Brooks brings incredible insight into the current state
of the military, and how it got to where it is. What influence does it
yield? Why? What are the consequences of that? I learned &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt;
reading this book, and like all the best books it gave me new
perspective and understanding of the world we live in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Sylvia Plath&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bell Jar flat out surprised me. I think of it as Classic Literature,
and often find that Classic Literature is too masculine or too opaque for
my casual reading tastes. This book was anything but! Plath's
semi-autobiographical novel is the beautiful story of a young woman trying
to find her&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11447921-beautiful-ruins"&gt;Beautiful Ruins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Jess Walter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to conceive of a book that successfully explores so many characters,
time periods, locations, and relationships in a cohesive story. But Walter is
able to take us from the Italian coast in the 1960's to modern day Hollywood to
the middle of nowhere Idaho without muddling the story or confusing the reader.
Rich characters, interesting plot, and Hollywood glamour make this a delightful
read.&lt;/p&gt;

the mind, and her experiences with mental illness.
Semi-autobiographical, the language Plath uses to describe her/Esther's
outlook, experiences, and later treatments is &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt;. Her writing
puts the reader right into Esther's head, and gives them an
understanding of what living with a mental illness is like. Even
better, her language changes throughout the novel as Esther's health
changes, reflecting her darker moods, as well as her better days.
Esther is a fantastically sympathetic and vibrant character, despite
her cynicism and depression. I found myself really invested in her
story and experiences, and again Plath's writing paints a luscious
picture of that story. I don't want to oversell this novel -- I think
part of why I loved it is because I came into it expecting it to be
Yet Another Classic Book which I often find to be overly masculine.
But this wasn't. Throughout the book, even at the peak of Esther's
descent into mental illness, I found myself identifying really
strongly with her and investing in what happened to her. It feels rare
to read a book in a woman's voice that's highly regarded, and I was
very pleasantly surprised by the femininity that colors the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this was another great read. Again, expectations definitely
may have played into my reading, but on the whole I was blown away by
the style, substance, characters, and story of The Bell Jar. Highly,
highly recommended summer reading!&lt;/p&gt;

be the best book I read this year. The military has never been a part
of the cultures I grew up in, so my knowledge and awareness of
what the military is, how it's run, and what it does is basically
nothing. I couldn't even tell you all of the branches, or the
distinctions between them. With this context in mind, this book held
incredible insight for me. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rosabrooks.com/"&gt;Rosa Brooks&lt;/a&gt;, a former reporter for the
Pentagon, explains not only what the military does but why it does it,
how it does it, what impacts those actions have. She's able to support
her claims with ample evidence as well as personal stories, and
defends her statements and positions from every possible angle. She
also looks at various parts of the military under a microscope,
explaining the history of this unit or that organization and where
they are today, and also looks very broadly at the military as a whole
complex system and how that system is working. She asks questions like
&amp;quot;What does it mean to be a solider, both historically and today? How
has that role changed in the last 2000 years and in the last decade?&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;Why is our military a proxy for diplomacy, nation building, and
relief effort?&amp;quot;. She explores the relationship between soldiers and
civilians, and how that too has changed dramatically over time.
I came away from the book with a greater
understanding of our military's history, it's present state, and how
it came to be the way that it is. I know more about what the military
does and why it does it, and the pros and cons of having the military
partake in all of the actions that it does.&lt;/p&gt;

daughters married to a man of means. What I loved about Eligible was
that the author stayed very true to the characters while modernizing
them seamlessly. Jane is sensible and pragmatic, Mrs.Bennet is
exasperated and a little manipulative, Lydia and Kitty are thick as
thieves and a little wild, and Mary is awkward and unaware. Avid P&amp;amp;P
fans (ahem, Mackenzie Broderick) may hold a more critical eye to the
novel, but a pleb like me who has only read P&amp;amp;P twice will no doubt
enjoy the classic tale of women, ambitions, and marriage, told in a
modern setting.&lt;/p&gt;

Out of It&lt;/a&gt;. I had seen this book splashed across the Powell's 'New +
Recommended' lists, in the hands and Instagram accounts of
celebrities, and even had it on personal recommendation from a friend.
And it could not have come at a better time. Jessi's book is all about
coming of age, but instead of focusing on adolescence she focuses on
her twenties and thirties. From terrible boyfriends, to better
boyfriends, to a fiancee, and finally to her pregnancy and child
rearing, Klein's book was a laugh and a comfort when I needed it most.
As comfortable as my situation is now, thinking about the future
&lt;em&gt;terrifies&lt;/em&gt; me. How am I going to have kids &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a career? Do I even
want kids? Do I even want a career? Do I want &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; career? What if
things don't work out with my current SO? What if I can't get
pregnant? Or worse, what if I &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; get pregnant? Oh god oh god oh
god oh god oh god oh god. I know I'm not alone, that my millennial
peers are worrying the same worries and fearing the same futures. But
it's still so profoundly comforting to hear the journey of someone you
admire. That the best laid plans often go astray, and that &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;
planning can work itself out. That &lt;strong&gt;you will be OK&lt;/strong&gt; because Jessi
was OK and she doesn't have this any more figured out than you do.
I highly highly highly recommend this book. It will be a friend to
you, no matter where you are or where you see your life going. It will
get you through those dark January days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 The bright side (ha) is that, because I get into the office before
sunrise and leave after sunset, I don't need to wear sunscreen. Score.&lt;/p&gt;

to the book on tape where flipping to page 129 wasn't exactly feasible
:p . The author himself narrates it though, and did his best to take
us through the book from start to finish without getting lost along
the way. NPH's past, from aspiring adolescent actor to young stardom
to proud husband and parent, is an interesting story told with classic
NPH humor. I can't say it was my favorite autobiography, as it
definitely erred on the side of trying too hard to be funny rather
than genuine or meaningful. But, walking the streets of San Francisco,
this book definitely held my interested and brightened my days. It was
entertaining, but didn't leave me feeling like I had insight into who
NPH was as a person at all. I will say, though, that listening to him
talk (or read aloud) about his kids was &lt;em&gt;heart melting&lt;/em&gt;.  I had no
idea what the experiences of being a &amp;quot;closeted&amp;quot; gay celebrity or a gay couple trying to
have kids were, and hearing about those first-hand was super
interesting. Definitely a tiny drop of knowledge from a world I know
little or nothing about, which is always excellent!  Overall, I
definitely recommend this book if you're looking for something light,
that doesn't require too much attention, or love all things NPH.&lt;/p&gt;

follows Eleanor through a particularly whirl-wind day, from her son
Timby feigning illness to her husband becoming an unexpected
Christian. It was charming and short, definitely a decent mindless
read to have on as background noise. Though the main character,
Eleanor, was entertaining I didn't find that I connected with her very
much, or particularly cared what happened to her. That's more on me
than the novel -- she's a nuanced and well-formed character, a mildly
neurotic housewife doing her best amid the mess that is Life, who I
think a lot of people &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; resonate with.  I just didn't. But beyond
that, the book was honestly boring. Boring books aren't always bad,
they can keep you company and fill the space between more grandiose
cousins. But at the end of the day there's nothing memorable, lasting,
or insightful about the book. If you're looking for something to pick
up this isn't the first thing I'd recommend, but it's not the worst
choice either.  It's the 'meh' choice.&lt;/p&gt;

abusive relationships aren't usually as black-and-white as we like to
think. 'It Ends With Us' follows Lily Bloom as she opens her own
flower shop and falls in love with a surgeon, Ryle Kincaid. With a
history of abuse in the family and vivid memories of her mother
covered in bruises and cuts, Lily knows too well the cycle of violence
and apology that so many abusive men exhibit. But when her
relationship with Ryle takes increasingly dark turns, she denies that
anything is wrong. At first they seem like such small incidents --
things that could happen to anybody. We all lose our tempers, or lash
out when we don't mean to. But as Ryle becomes her husband, and then
the father of her child, his violence escalates. With her own daughter
on the way, she's faced with a choice: be just like her mother, or
leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'It Ends With Us' was deeply personal for Colleen Hoover, and that shines
through in the novel. The characters are rich and sympathetic, and
they show the nuance and shades of grey in an abusive relationship.
It's easy to look in from the outside and judge victims of abuse for
staying. How can they not see what's happening to them? How can they
live each day with people who hit them, or scream at them? 'It Ends
With Us' helped me understand how those relationships are like frogs
in hot water, how abusive husbands can have a lot of good qualities
and think they are good people (though make no mistake, they are
&lt;em&gt;monsters&lt;/em&gt;), and how it can be easy to explain away incidents of
abuse. I won't spoil anything, but I will say that there's also a very
happy ending, which was well worth sticking around for!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was deeply touched by 'It Ends With Us', and came away not only with
another good love story in my ears but with a deeper understanding of
what victims of abuse go through. The mark of a great book is one that
not only entertains and rivets, but that changes the way you move
through everyday life and see the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't overstate how much I love audiobooks. I spend so much time
walking, running, doing laundry, cooking, stretching, &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt;, and
being able to spend that time with a book in my ears has been
life changing. I use &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://app.overdrive.com/"&gt;Overdrive&lt;/a&gt; (way better than Audible!), which
connects to your local library and lets you download e-books and
audiobooks to any device, including &lt;em&gt;your phone&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;For free&lt;/strong&gt;.
Fancy, right? Here's how you can turn that into a non-reader gift:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set it up&lt;/strong&gt;. Installing the app, connecting it to the library,
downloading books, connecting the phone to the
car...it can be a lot. Getting everything ready to go so your loved
one just has to press 'play' could be the push they need to remember
how much they love books!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CDs&lt;/strong&gt;. I know I know I know. But again, sometimes setting it all
up on the phone is just too much.  Give your loved one a book on
tape they can play in the car. Especially perfect if you've got an
upcoming road trip!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your own recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;. Sharing a book together is a beautiful
thing. Seeing a novel through someone else's eyes can open up new
perspectives, interpretations, and meaning you may not have seen.
And you get to share a thing you love with a person you love.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="coloring-books"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Coloring Books&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've seen them.  You've thought &amp;quot;Really? Adult coloring books?&amp;quot;.
Your friend's mom has one. And now, your mom can have one too!
Coloring is meditative, methodic, excellent to keep your hands busy
while watching TV.  Here are a few that look neat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="graphic-novels"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Graphic Novels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just for kids! Graphic novels have grown into beautifully
illustrated, intricate stories with as much character development,
plot, and meaning as any other book.  Here are a few that are really
stunning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25179.Blankets"&gt;Blankets&lt;/a&gt; by Craig Thompson. This was definitely the first graphic
novel I read where I realized what a graphic novel could be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22040598-the-sculptor"&gt;The Sculptor&lt;/a&gt; by Scott McCloud. Per the recommendation of my SO, a
graphic novel fan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="for-the-history-buff"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For the History Buff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27209433-white-trash"&gt;White Trash: The 400-Year Untold History of Class in America&lt;/a&gt; by
Nancy Isenberg. America is hardly classless,
anybody-can-be-anything country  we like to think it is. This book
recounts the history of the mistreatment of the poor, and discusses
the surprising origins of elitism in the US (hint: owning land used
to be a BFD).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077874-hrc"&gt;HRC&lt;/a&gt; by Amie Parnes and Jonathan Allen. You may as well start
reading up on the life and times of our future president ;) It
focuses on her time as Secretary of State, but I think it has great
insight into how she makes decisions, what motivates her, and is
relatively objective and accurate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="for-the-girl-boss"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For the Girl Boss&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far the hardest category to narrow down, it's hard to go wrong with
any of these titles for the feminist reader (woops, sorry, I
misspelled 'everyone') in your life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33257571-too-fat-too-slutty-too-loud"&gt;Too Fat, Too Slutty, Too Loud&lt;/a&gt; by Anne Helen Petersen. I expected
this to be a ranty read about how women are oppressed, and instead
got some of the best essays I've ever read. This book describes how
women are scrutinized and judged by examining 9 famous women who are
too-something: too strong, too pregnant, too old, too shrill. A
great read!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29340182-shrill"&gt;Shrill&lt;/a&gt; by Lindy West. So many 'aha' moments in this book.
Lindy West names and confronts some uncomfortable truths in this
book.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll become a better human.
Really you should just get it for yourself as a present.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29405093-the-girl-with-the-lower-back-tattoo"&gt;The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo&lt;/a&gt; by Amy Schumer. An incredibly
intimate look into who Amy Schumer is, and how she came to be the
person she is today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12262741-wild"&gt;Wild&lt;/a&gt; by Cheryl Strayed. I know this book was trendier last year,
but if your loved one didn't get a chance to read it it's well worth
coming back to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17851885-i-am-malala"&gt;I am Malala&lt;/a&gt; by Malala Yousafzai. If you're not sure who she is,
you &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; need to read this.  If you know her, you know why
you need to read this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20910157-yes-please"&gt;Yes, Please&lt;/a&gt; by Amy Pohler. The life and times of an amazing
woman, featuring some great advice we could all use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="for-the-mathlete"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For the Mathlete&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are ordered by difficulty + level of math, from most advanced to
most accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24113.G_del_Escher_Bach"&gt;GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach&lt;/a&gt; by Douglas Hofstadter is a mind-bending, brain-exploding math +
philosophy book. This is perfect your friend who just started grad
school.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17290683-love-and-math"&gt;Love and Math&lt;/a&gt; by Edward Frenkel is just a great math book.  Part memoir, part
linear algebra, Edward Frenkel discusses how he came to love math,
what he endured to be part of the mathematics community, and what he
spent his life researching and discovering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693884-how-not-to-be-wrong"&gt;How Not to Be Wrong&lt;/a&gt; by Jordan Ellenberg is for the armchair mathematician. It's a
critical analysis of how we approach problems, and common data
analytics methods.  More &amp;quot;How to think about this real-world issue&amp;quot; than
&amp;quot;Here's how Andrew Wiles solved the Fermat Theorem&amp;quot;.  My favorite
quote is:
&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;And you can't deny that there are aspects of the natural
world - I'm thinking pandas here - that seem more likely to have
resulted from grudging bureaucratic compromise than from the mind of
an all knowing deity with total creative control&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="for-the-csi-fan"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For the CSI Fan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've unexpectedly started reading mysteries recently. I
didn't even know what I was getting myself into, but here are a few
juicy ones I've enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Big Little Lies&lt;/cite&gt; by Liane Moriarty. I'm sure that every
self-respecting mystery reader has already read through Liane
Moriarty's entire catalog. BUT IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO HASN'T, do
them a favor and get them this book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27274343-i-m-thinking-of-ending-things"&gt;I'm Thinking of Ending Things&lt;/a&gt; by Iain Reid. A short but
satisfying thriller.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26114146-all-is-not-forgotten"&gt;All is Not Forgotten&lt;/a&gt; by Wendy Walker. As a mystery noob, I'm &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt;
invested in this book. Is it the son?  The pot dealer? I was hooked,
and so satisfied by the ending.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22557272-the-girl-on-the-train"&gt;The Girl on the Train&lt;/a&gt; by Paula Hawkins. Honestly, when I first read it I
thought it was a little meh. I had a hard time connecting to the
main character, or caring about what happened to her. But with all
the hype + the movie, I may have to give it another read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="for-the-friend-with-a-bb8-pillow"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For the Friend with a BB8 Pillow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AKA Sci-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/375802.Ender_s_Game"&gt;Ender's Game&lt;/a&gt; by Orson Scott Card is a classic sci-fi read that
lives up to it's legendary status.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9969571-ready-player-one"&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/a&gt; by Ernest Cline is a totally accessible and fun
story. It's a classic hero's tale, with 80's geek and gamer culture
mixed in. Highly recommend for readers of any age.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12007.Use_of_Weapons"&gt;Use of Weapons&lt;/a&gt; by Iain Banks is by far my favorite sci-fi book.
Great characters, an excellent ending, compelling plot, and very
interesting premise. Highly, highly recommend for all readers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59924.The_Lathe_of_Heaven"&gt;The Lathe of Heaven&lt;/a&gt; by Ursula K. LeGuin is a solid, satisfying
sci-fi adventure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="for-the-people-person"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For the People Person&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section is really just an excuse to recommend &lt;a class="reference internal" href="#when-breath-becomes-air"&gt;When Breath
Becomes Air&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="#when-breath-becomes-air"&gt;When Breath Becomes Air&lt;/a&gt; by Paul Kalanathi is the heartbreaking
story of a young neurosurgeon diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer.
Intimate with the American healthcare system as both a doctor and a
patient, this book has fascinating insights and thoughts around the
ultimate question: &lt;em&gt;What makes life worth living?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="#the-audacity-of-hope"&gt;The Audacity of Hope&lt;/a&gt; by Barack Obama, for when you need to
revitalize your faith in our country's politicians.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="the-audacity-of-hope"&gt;&lt;span id="when-breath-becomes-air"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;And that's all she wrote, folks! I hope you have a wonderful holiday
season, surrounded by family and friends you love â™¥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

was a surprising delight to read. Like most books I checked it out
only knowing that Powell's had it on their 'New + Recommended' list,
and was pleased when I found myself in the middle of a psychological
thriller, begging the protagonist not to go into the basement. The
novel starts out innocuously, and it wasn't until maybe 2/3 of the way
through that I realized it wasn't going the direction I expected &lt;em&gt;at
all&lt;/em&gt;.  I don't want to give too much away, but this a quick and
satisfying read if you're up for a little horror and a little thrill.
The ending is entirely unexpected, and raises a lot of interesting
points about our identity, perceptions, reality, and the pliability of
the human mind.  I would highly highly recommend it!&lt;/p&gt;

since it had been hyped so much, and after reading it am somewhat
mystified by the noise around it.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't a
&lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; book.  But if I had the ear of millions of people, it's
definitely not the first one I would recommend either. I'll start with
what I liked, compliment sandwich style.  Emma Cline's use of language
is incredible, and her ability to set a scene and make you &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt;
every detail of that scene is unparalleled.  Those tiny things you
notice but would never think to write down, or describe in the way she
does, and then the way she builds entire characters and events out of
those details is amazing. You can feel sticky heat, the stings of
shame, the meaning imbued in a moment's hesitation or a sideways
glance.  All of those microscopic tinges are blown up to full size,
and make the book &lt;em&gt;rich&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so, I loved Cline's writing, why was the book just meh? The
content was really the downfall of this book.  I didn't find any of
the characters compelling, and found it &lt;em&gt;painfully&lt;/em&gt; slow at many
points. There's a murder set up in the opening paragraphs which
becomes the climax of the story, but the journey to that climax takes
&lt;em&gt;so long&lt;/em&gt; and involves little to no detail about the murder.  Someone
dies, and we don't even know or care about that person. The murder is
supposed to be the climax, but at the end falls utterly flat.  I will
give Cline credit for her time-jumping between modern day and memory.
She used it well to develop the main character and made it obvious which
era you were currently reading, both of which are hard to do well and
hard to do well at the same time. But in the end that definitely
couldn't save a half-hearted story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're thinking about picking it up, and leave it at the bottom of
your to-read list. It's definitely worth giving a try, but I wouldn't
hurry to read it.&lt;/p&gt;

read &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.garthstein.com/works/the-art-of-racing-in-the-rain/"&gt;The Art of Racing in the Rain&lt;/a&gt; by Garth Stein. As a dog owner
and lover I was simultaneously excited and wary of another book about
a dog where the dog inevitably the dog dies at the end. But I set
aside my trepidation and dove in, and was rewarded tremendously for
doing so! The book is narrated by a dog, Enzo, as he chronicles the
life of his beloved owner Denny. But it is about &lt;em&gt;so much more&lt;/em&gt; than
the relationship between a man and his dog.  It's about the pain of
cancer and death, the different ways we grieve, and ultimately focuses
on how bad things happen to good people. It's about making the hardest
right decisions, about being the bigger person, all told through the
lens of racing (yes, car racing) by the canine narrator.  And it made
me &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; so strongly.  I had such visceral reactions to the events of
the book, and realized that was part of what made it so good.  The
characters were so compelling, the events so relatable, I found my
blood boiling at points, experienced jubilation and depression and
grief right alongside the characters.  So much malice! So much hope!
The role of the dog as narrator doesn't even really stand out in
hindsight, as it's completely eclipsed by the richness of the rest of
the novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if you couldn't tell, I loved the book and would highly
recommend it. I'll admit it starts out a little slow, but try to power
through at least 1/3 of it before giving up entirely (it's a short
read). It made my rainy Sunday fly by, and is appropriately the perfect
rainy-weekend companion :)&lt;/p&gt;

Fall is here, in case you hadn't noticed yet, and
with rainy Sundays and long bus rides to school ahead it's time to

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29405093-the-girl-with-the-lower-back-tattoo"&gt;The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo&lt;/a&gt; by Amy
Schumer. Not just
another comedian's memoir, Amy's book offers fascinating insight into
how she became the person (and celebrity) she is today.  With
heartbreaking stories and a sprinkling of levity, this might be my
favorite read of the year to date.  You can read more of my thoughts
on the book &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/tgwtlbt.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25472765-american-housewife"&gt;American Housewife&lt;/a&gt; by Helen Ellis.  This is a quirky yet
relatable collection of short stories about what it means to be a
modern woman.  My favorite story was hands down The Fitter, but each
is a gem unto itself.  Want to know what it's about? You know how to
find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;

I love me a good memoir, and Carrie's was the perfect scratch
for my itch. Like Amy Schumer's memoir, HMMaMG is raw and
unapologetic, describing some of the hardest parts of her life and

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25899336-when-breath-becomes-air"&gt;When Breath Becomes Air&lt;/a&gt; by Paul Kalanithi. I didn't know much
about this book going in, but was stunned by the eloquence and voice
of Paul's writing. His story is interesting and deeply sad, and I
found myself crying on the way to class at the end. Definitely a
short but worthwhile read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26067909-the-assistants"&gt;The Assistants&lt;/a&gt; by Camille Perri. Part office gossip, part juicy
crime novel, I couldn't read this book fast enough.  I loved Camille's
characters, the genius (and not contrived) story, the setting and
conflicts and intimacies of people we work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29340182-shrill"&gt;Shrill&lt;/a&gt; by Lindy West. A reminder that we are all human beings, and
that we need to treat each other accordingly. But told really, really
well. Seriously, just read it, and become the better person you know
you can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it!  Happy reading beautiful people, and as always feel free to

recommendations of your own, comments, or concerns!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 I don't have a comments section on my blog because I find they often
become ugly places on the internet. I'm not saying &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; would write
anything terrible, but it just felt like asking for trouble. You can

as 'Feminist', whatever that means, but didn't know much else going
in.  Unlike many books I finish, my feelings about it are complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is a chronicle of terrible experiences she has had around
gender, from getting cat-called, to being in abusive relationships,
to getting death threats on the internet.  While I identified with a
number of her experiences and appreciated that her book made me
think more about how I'm treated, I finished it feeling sad and very
much tired of talking about gender.  There's no call to action or
even real cause-effect to her stories. It's just the stories as they
happened, told like the script for a movie: all facts, with little
&amp;quot;Here's how this &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have happened&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Here's what you, as a
man, woman, or child, can do&amp;quot; or even &amp;quot;Here's how I wish I had
reacted&amp;quot;.  I find so often that when &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.lucywyman.me/boy.html"&gt;men don't treat me with
respect&lt;/a&gt; I have no idea how to react in the moment, and wish that
she had provided some guidance or thoughts there.  In the end, she
was only telling me things I already knew with no revelatory
thoughts.  Her book didn't change how I see her, how I see the
world, how I react to various situations, or how I understand gender
or being a woman.  Perhaps she was targeting those who don't even
realize what misogyny looks like, or how common aggression is, but
honestly those people are not the same people who are going to be
reading her book. The people who are going to read her book are
people like me, who know and recognize that they are frequently
treated like sex objects.  In the end, I feel sorry for how
extremely unpleasant many of her experiences are, and that there's
little or nothing she and I can do about it, but I didn't need to
read this book to understand that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for other great reads by great women, I'd
recommend picking up Amy Schumer's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29405093-the-girl-with-the-lower-back-tattoo"&gt;The Girl with the Lower Back
Tattoo&lt;/a&gt;, Jenny Lawson's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23848559-furiously-happy"&gt;Furiously Happy&lt;/a&gt;, Mindy Kaling's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10335308-is-everyone-hanging-out-without-me"&gt;Is
Everyone Hanging Out Without Me&lt;/a&gt;, or Lindy West's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29340182-shrill"&gt;Shrill&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit (10/11/2016):&lt;/strong&gt; I've meditated on the purpose of 'Sex Object'
since writing this, and I think there are a few possible and very
worthwhile reasons she wrote it. First and foremost is to process,
understand, and ultimately come to terms with her experiences.  I hope
she found some modicum (however small) of peace or catharsis in
writing the book.  Second, though, I think it is to tell other women
they are not alone. That sexism and degradation are systemic,
pervasive, and that it is not &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;their fault&lt;/em&gt;.  I know for
many women, including my own mother, the issue of blame and cause is
placed on them instead of the actual actors and perpetrators.  I also want to
acknowledge that to some extent my critique is unrealistic: there
&lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; a solution, an action I should have taken or can take in the
future, to make this better.  There is no call to action because the
best any of us can do is exactly what she did: talk about it, openly
and frankly, and about why it's wrong.  In the end, I think the book
left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth, but I don't think that's
Jessica Valenti's fault, or any reason to not read her book. If
anything, it's a reason you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; read her book.&lt;/p&gt;

books.  This is in part because so much of my attention was directed at my
new job, in part because nothing I was really excited to read came in, in
part because I was spending a lot of time with my boyfriend before he went
back to school.  But I was ready to break my reading-lull when Amy Schumer's
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29405093-the-girl-with-the-lower-back-tattoo"&gt;The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo&lt;/a&gt; showed up in my reading queue.  Amy
Schumer's not someone I pin all of my feminist hopes and dreams (and labels)
to, but I do appreciate her work and many of the ideas she promotes. Needless
to say I was very excited to read her book (the latest in a long list of
biographies I have read and loved!), and it did not disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TGwtLBT is just as much about the hard, scary, sad parts of Amy's life as it
is about the funny, awkward, we've-all-had-this-happen experiences she's had.
Ultimately it's about the experiences that shaped the person and celebrity
she is today, told honestly and sprinkled with humor.  What made the book
stand out was that she wasn't &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to be funny. Often comedian's books
become comedy sets, told in book form. This is fine to an extent, but offers
no insight into who that person is, or what unique experiences they've had.
Instead of trying to make you laugh Amy tells her story as it is, throwing in
jokes and levity where appropriate without sacrificing the integrity of the
book.  More than a fun pick-me-up read, Amy's book helped me understand how
to interact with the mentally ill, how to handle sexist comments, how to be a
person in the world just a tiny bit better.  If you haven't got your hands on
a copy yet, I can't recommend it enough!&lt;/p&gt;

then those &lt;em&gt;sappy&lt;/em&gt; ads began running a few weeks later and I got
worried.  Don't let the ads fool you though: this was a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; novel.
I laughed. I cried. I finished it in two days.  The book follows
Louisa Clark, a recently unemployed barista who needs a job to help
her family make ends meet. She takes a job as a sort of low-level
care-giver for a quadriplegic man named Will Traynor, and soon finds
out that he plans to carry out assisted suicide in a few months.  She
takes that time to try to convince him that life, even in a wheelchair
with limited mobility, is worth living, a task which ends up taking
the couple on some (mis)adventures.  It's...kind of a love story?
There's definitely romance. But also &lt;em&gt;so much more&lt;/em&gt;.  As an
able-bodied person, we so rarely think about accessibility, and
increasing the comfort and quality of life for those with
disabilities.  I had never thought about how hard navigating the mall
would be in a wheel chair, how it would feel to not be able to
exercise, and how out of control every aspect of life would be. This
read definitely changed my view of disability, and gave me a lot of
appreciation and gratitude for my body.  It sounds heavy now, but this
book is &lt;em&gt;juicy&lt;/em&gt; as well. 100% page turner.  Definitely worth putting
on your summer list!&lt;/p&gt;

you know you'll be tripping to Powell's to pick up some summer reads.
I wanted to make this a regular reading list with a variety of ficiton
and nonfiction books, and I realized that 90% of my choices were
biographies or memoirs.  If you're not into them, don't despair! There are
a few juicy fictional reads at the top of the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_potter_series"&gt;The Harry Potter Series&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on your appetite this series
can take a while, but I recently re-read the whole series and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/harry-potter-series.html"&gt;loved it&lt;/a&gt;.  Definitely worth revisiting if you haven't in a
while, or if you've never read them to begin with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Help"&gt;The Help&lt;/a&gt;. If you haven't already, you should.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/me-before-you"&gt;Me Before You&lt;/a&gt;. I know, I know, it's on every list. I was
skeptical too. But trust me, this book is &lt;em&gt;candy&lt;/em&gt;. Excellent for
any reader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_Weapons"&gt;Use of Weapons&lt;/a&gt;. Even if you aren't familiar with the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_series"&gt;Culture series&lt;/a&gt;,
and don't want to read all 9 books, Use of Weapons is a fantastic stand alone
novel.  The chapters alternate between going forwards in time and backwards,
the characters are impossibly rich and well written, and the twist at the
end will leave you speechless and teary-eyed. Even if you're not a sci-fi
buff, definitely worth reading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/books/committed-a-love-story/"&gt;Committed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/"&gt;Big Magic&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/books/eat-pray-love/"&gt;Eat, Pray, Love&lt;/a&gt;.
You've definitely heard of the last one, but
the first is &lt;em&gt;so much better&lt;/em&gt;. Elizabeth Gilbert is 100% my favorite author,
my guilty pleasure, my comfort food, and her voice is miraculous. I like her
non-fiction better than her fiction (just personally, no literary criticism
here), but anything she writes will definitely lift your day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://thebloggess.com/furiously-happy/"&gt;Furiously Happy&lt;/a&gt;. I'm not sure if this qualifies as a biography, but it
seems close enough. I've read &lt;em&gt;several&lt;/em&gt; comedic ladies biographies (
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/books/bossypants-by-tina-fey-review.html"&gt;Bossypants&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://amysaysyesplease.com/"&gt;Yes Please&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11230081-seriously-i-m-kidding"&gt;Seriously, I'm Kidding&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.avclub.com/review/mindy-kalingem-is-everyone-hanging-out-without-me--64875"&gt;Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) and though hilarious and
inspiring I find the story often gets lost in the authors trying to be
funny. Granted being funny in writing (even in an audiobook) is like marathon
level hard. But &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://thebloggess.com/"&gt;Jenny Lawson&lt;/a&gt; definitely pulls it off in her reading of
her second book &amp;quot;Furiously Happy&amp;quot;, and includes a lot of personal moments
that help plebs like me understand mental illness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://piperkerman.com/orange/about-the-book/"&gt;Orange is the New Black&lt;/a&gt;. I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; the show, but it definitely takes
a lot of artistic license. Piper's actual experience, though less exciting,
is fascinating and well-told.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anything by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sedaris#Bibliography"&gt;David Sedaris&lt;/a&gt;. I especially love &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holidays_on_Ice"&gt;Holidays on Ice&lt;/a&gt;, if you're
a Sedaris newbie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Audacity_of_Hope"&gt;The Audacity of Hope&lt;/a&gt;. Perfect for a quick weekend read, Obama's cool
personal story and charismatic voice make this feel good, palate-cleanser
sort of book. Remind yourself there's good in the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

great or anything, nor does it claim to be. It's a very real portrait of
high school, and of someone you know of (but don't really &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt;) dying.
As with any media set in high school your mileage may vary -- no one
has the same experience, and there were definitely a lot of inconsistencies
with my experience of high school. But no matter what your experience was,
it takes you back to the time before adulthood, and the first time you
experienced that confusion and sadness of loss. The main character, Greg,
is a self-depricating, uninspired human in the thick of the teenage years.
He's incredibly well-written, and allows you to forget that he's totally
fiction. It was a great break from
a few more heady books I'm in the middle of, and is a great weekend read
if you're looking for something more seroius than a romance novel but less
serious than LOTR.&lt;/p&gt;

it was made into a movie, and had something to do with a
young woman, the early 20th century, and probably
Brooklyn, NY.  Honestly, even that was too much:
I spent much of my time reading it trying to figure out
why someone would choose to turn &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; book into a film
and came away disappointed.  It was blasÃ©, and while I
don't want to diminish the experience of immigrants
to NY in the early 1900s there was nothing unique,
clever, eye-opening, or otherwise remarkable about the novel.
I liked the main character well enough, but found that
in the end I didn't care what happened to her or any of
the other characters. The main character Eilis and her
sister Rose feel very much like female characters written by
a man. You can very clearly see the lens through which
he views them, the brush strokes he uses to create them,
and that makes them seem very unreal.  They feel more
like what you would get if you asked your well-meaning
grandfather to describe his first love interest than
real women, and without the connection to the characters
I found myself struggling to hold on to anything in the
novel.  I appreciate that TÃ³ibÃ­n wrote a novel that centered
on strong female characters, and that such a novel
could be turned into an award-winning film. But before
we congratulate ourselves on appreciating a novel about
a woman who travels alone to America, goes to college
and works, and chats with her sister and female roommates,
let's consider that Eilis probably experienced a lot of
fear, racism, sexism, uncertainty, and hardship that
is generally glossed over. Overall I was underwhelmed,
and wouldn't recommend it if you've got other books
on your list to read.&lt;/p&gt;

describing how math is used (and misused) in everyday
life. From the lottery, to elections, to predicting
the weather and the existence of God, Ellenburg
explains how to develop a better intuition for all the number
and percentages swirling around the news and media. It
focuses mostly on statistics, but also delves into
geometry + algebra (and their relationship), multi-dimensional
spaces and linear algebra, and number theory. As a
&amp;quot;relatively mathy&amp;quot; person, I definitely felt like I got a
lot out of it,though I'm not entirely sure I would recommend
it to less mathematically-inclined readers. Although I believe
it was intended for that audience, and is definitely an
accessible view into high mathematics, it's also a book
about math. My point being: don't expect to be spoon fed
math and magically become knowledgable. Like with all knowledge,
you've gotta put in a little work. But it's &lt;em&gt;totally worth it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Some favorite quotes:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;And you can't deny that there are aspects of the natural world - I'm
thinking pandas here - that seem more likely to have resulted from grudging
bureaucratic compromise than from the mind of an all knowing deity with
total creative control&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;For those who are willing to adopt a view of probability as degree of belief
Bayes theorem can be seen not as a mere mathematical equation, but as a form
of mathematically flavored advice&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;

including depression and anxiety.  I'm not really sure if it's a
memoir or autobiography or neither, but you can think of it as a
series of blog posts about things that happen in her life, and her
thoughts.  It is &lt;em&gt;hilarious&lt;/em&gt;, and poignant, and helps people who don't
have disorders understand what's it like to have a disorder (I
think....I don't have a disorder, so can't confirm this, but I
definitely &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like I have a better understanding of them now).
She describes what it's like when they get especially bad in very
relatable ways, using experiences that most humans have had, and
without asking for pity.  It's also not just about feels and sad
things -- she narrates her life with silliness and humor, and many of
the experiences themselves are hilarious as well. From waking up to
find her arms are asleep, to having her daughter congratulate her on
making friends, Lawson talks about experiences we've all had without
fear of self-deprecation.  &amp;quot;Furiously Happy&amp;quot; is a fun and
thought-provoking read.  As a side note, I realize this whole post is
very effusive and only has nice things to say about the book. I
honestly have nothing bad to say about it. I expected it to be a quick
and funny read, and got &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more than I bargained for, which is just
about all you can ask of a book. As a sub-side-note, I highly
recommend the audio-book version as well. It's narrated by the author,
has several &amp;quot;extra&amp;quot; little bits in it, and Lawson's narration
definitely adds a lot to the experience of consuming the book.&lt;/p&gt;

We all do. The series has become an empire, with it's own movie series
and theme park, and no matter what subset of Harry Potter related
media you've experienced you have some thoughts about it. Regardless
of what those notions are -- good, bad, or ugly -- read on!  I have
had my own preconceptions about HP at various points in my life, and
after re-reading all seven books right in a row I can tell you that
many of them were turned upside down.  It may not be the series for
you, but before you go invest time in reading it, you may as well read
this way shorter blog post about it so you know what you're getting
into at least a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="preconceptions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Preconceptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many twenty-somethings, Harry Potter was the series of my
adolescence, and I grew up with Harry, Ron, and Hermione. I stood in
line for six hours to get the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th books, dressed as
a wizard and talking to other HP fans. I went to the midnight premier
of at least three of the movies.  I wasn't the most into it of all my
friends, but I drank the Kool-Aid. However, as I picked up the first
book again a few months ago I wasn't expecting Harry Potter to be a
great series.  I expected that they would be perfectly adequate tween
novels that I had loved in my youth but now, older and wiser, would
realize I had outgrown, like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Jackson_%26_the_Olympians"&gt;Percy Jackson&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.neopets.com"&gt;Neopets&lt;/a&gt;.  I'll get
to the chase you know is coming, reader: Harry Potter is not just a
kids book.  The characters are what make these books extraordinary, as
they are all layered, multidimensional, &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; people who reflect
modern society so well.  JK Rowling is able to capture the many ways
we judge other humans in her characters, and the lengths we'll go to
defend those judgements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-series"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Series&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the series is seven novels long, in reality it's one story
spanning seven years, that you do have to read in order and all of.
This isn't &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Ark"&gt;Animal Ark&lt;/a&gt; people.  There's no picking one book and
saying &amp;quot;Read this and you've read them all&amp;quot;.  That said, &lt;em&gt;it's 100%
worth it&lt;/em&gt;.  And I will say, some of the books are better than others.
My personal favorite was &amp;quot;The Half-Blood Prince&amp;quot;, but there is no
weak-link in the set, or book I finished and thought &amp;quot;Man, I really
hope the next one is better&amp;quot;. &lt;strong&gt;TL;DR Yes you have to read them all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-i-loved"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I loved&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Characters&lt;/strong&gt;. Growing up, all I remember is hating Snape. I had
no recollection of what an incredible character he is, so painfully
human and deeply entangled in the story.  The Malfoys, the Weasleys,
each delicately balanced between family and principles, conflicted
in how to choose what's best for those they love. So. Good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The HP Universe&lt;/strong&gt;.  JK Rowlings universe is very well thought out,
with details like government policy, racial prejudices, and even
the &lt;em&gt;botany&lt;/em&gt; of the universe created from scratch and implemented
perfectly.  Percy stresses about regulating cauldron-bottoms to be
thick enough. Neville knows the properties of Gillyweed and Devil's Snare.
History class is boring, standardized tests are stressful, and
non-wizards, muggle-born wizards, and women are all placed in a
social hierarchy similar to the racial strata that exists today.
The detail and consistency here is incredible, and makes the magical
world of Harry Potter that much more immersive and &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Form&lt;/strong&gt;.  Did you ever notice that there are no swear words in
Harry Potter?  And no modern technology more recent than a telephone or
TV, despite that these were written as iphones and laptops were
being developed and changing the world. It's executed so well that
you don't even notice.  There are prominent and powerful women,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Themes&lt;/strong&gt;. Rowling uses Harry Potter to explore coming of age,
racism and the hatred that arises from misunderstanding, corrupt
politics, greed, the psychology of abusive relationships, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's timeless&lt;/strong&gt;.  My second time through I feel as though I've barely scratched the
surface of deriving meaning from this series, and the layers of
complexity make this an excellent book for readers of all ages
and stages of life. I love that the series grows with you, taking
on new meaning each time it's revisited, and it makes me so excited
to read the series again in the future and see how it changes.  The
technology (or lack thereof) also adds to this timelessness, and
even a hundred years from now the books will still be just as relevant
and relatable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've made it this far: you know how I feel.  If you have any
questions, comments, or concerns, please email me at

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.carriebrownstein.com/"&gt;Carrie Brownstein&lt;/a&gt;. Brownstein's memoir of her
time in the band &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sleater-kinney.com/"&gt;Sleater-Kinney&lt;/a&gt;, this book was raw to the point
of discomfort. Whatever opinions I may have, they're outweighed
by the respect I have for Brownstein's openness, vulnerability, and honesty.
The whole book, beginning to end, is one long intimate passage into
the private lives of herself, her family, and her bandmates, sharing
details I would cringe to tell my own friends, let alone publish
for the world to read. More than anything I'm in awe of her
talent for writing and fearless storytelling.  After the
amazement at her baring-all, though, I had a few other thoughts
on the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went in with few expectations and
scattered knowledge of Carrie Brownstein. I knew from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/"&gt;All Songs Considered&lt;/a&gt;
that she was a member of Sleater-Kinney, that she had worked briefly
for that podcast, and of course knew about her role in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ifc.com/shows/portlandia"&gt;Portlandia&lt;/a&gt;.
But I had never listened to Sleater-Kinney's music, much less studied their
past or had any part in the Pacific Northwest punk scene. In hindsight,
doing a little bit of studying before hand would have been helpful --
the book catalogs her experiences before, during, and briefly after
Sleater-Kinney exclusively, and she frequently references bands and
events I had never heard of, despite being so geographically and
temporally close to them.  This was a bug and a feature: knowing so
little made the book more educational, interesting, and worthwhile,
but also in many ways less meaningful or impactful for me personally.
That said, Brownstein includes so much more than just a history of
the band.  Her struggles with anxiety and depression, a variety
of physical conditions including shingles and an allergy to soy,
and hypochondria while touring with a band, are very much relatable
to any who has battled those same battles. She also speaks at length
of coming of age and finding what she wanted to do, of how her parents
own repressed selves affected her childhood, and of other
profound thoughts on the human experience in the modern age, and how
to navigate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, &amp;quot;Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl&amp;quot; was an enjoyable
and worthwhile read. Entertaining, insightful, and almost unbearably
honest, I would highly recommend picking this up if you have a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

One by Ernest Cline&lt;/a&gt;.  Set 30 years in the future, Ready Player One
depicts a bleak distopia where a MMORPG (massively multiplayer online
role playing game) called the OASIS is the only escape from reality,
and has in fact replaced it.  The novel follows teenager Wade Watts
through a Hunger Games-esque competition requiring expansive and
detailed knowledge of 80's tech culture, from video games to movies to
comic books and beyond.  This is a total candy read, and if you're
into science fiction or Neal Stephenson novels (particularly
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Reamde-A-Novel-Neal-Stephenson/dp/0062191497"&gt;Reamde&lt;/a&gt;), this would definitely be a good weekend pick-me-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, it didn't hit my literary sweet spot, but then again I
can't say I expected it to. I will say it was much more accessible
than I expected it to be, and aligned perfectly with my values:
intellect winning out over money; strong, rich, diverse characters;
well researched but not obscure.  Candy Read.  Without giving too much
away (fear not, read on), what made it most enjoyable was the very
distinct Good vs. Evil dynamic, and how each party was very clearly on
one side or the other. It was easy to root for the the protagonists,
against the antagonists, and just be along for the plot-ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's all she wrote.  My next review will be sometime next week
on Carrie Brownstein's memoir &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Hunger-Makes-Me-Modern-Girl/dp/1594486638"&gt;Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
