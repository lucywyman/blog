order to feel like I was doing something without actually doing anything. We donated and went to a
few protests as well, but I can't say I feel like I did my due diligence fighting racism this
summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; say that Ijeoma Oluo's &lt;em&gt;So You Want to Talk About Race&lt;/em&gt; was my favorite of the anti-racism
books I read though. Oluo's advice is concrete, practical, and actionable, and the book is
incredibly well laid out. Oluo explains not just how behaviors should change, but why those
behaviors are harmful. Her prose is empathetic without judging or blaming, and I found myself
thinking about or referring back to this guide often throughout the year. This was hands down the
best book I read in 2020, and I recommend everyone read it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RIYL&lt;/strong&gt;: Being a decent person&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;White Fragility&lt;/em&gt; asks it's readers to do more emotional work than &lt;em&gt;So You Want to Talk About Race&lt;/em&gt;,
which is uncomfortable and necessary. It was uncomfortable to confront that I'm not an exceptional or
enlightened white person, that &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; personally uphold and perpetuate racism and racist systems. Being
defensive, thinking you aren't part of the problem, and misdefining racism are all common ways that
white people refuse to confront or acknowledge that they are part of the racist system we live in.
And I'll be honest: I haven't done a lot of the work that &lt;em&gt;White Fragility&lt;/em&gt; asks of me, because it's
hard. This is definitely a book to keep coming back to continue to do the hard work of confronting
our racial prejudices, acknowledging the racist system that privileges white people, and doing the
personal work of realizing your role in that society and working against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book struck a chord with me. I loved the tension Georgia felt between loving her city and hating
its politics, between wanting to improve a system from within and abandon it altogether. &lt;em&gt;The
Antidote for Everything&lt;/em&gt; covers some remarkably heavy topics with a surprisingly light tone, and the
mystery at the center of the book kept me reading until the last page. While the plot is amazing,
the characters were what made this book 5 stars. Georgia and Jonah are so real, so quirky and
three-dimensional, it was like spending time with friends. I particularly identified with Georgia:
her experience of pressure to start a family, her variety of interests and curiosity about the
world, her kindness and goodness to her friends. I loved everything about her, and honestly can't
wait to re-read this book!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RIYL&lt;/strong&gt;: Lilly Pulitzer, costume jewelry, Fried Green Tomatoes, complicated friendships&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More poetic than &lt;em&gt;So You Want to Talk About Race&lt;/em&gt;, but less breathtaking than &lt;em&gt;Between the World and
Me&lt;/em&gt;, I was admittedly underwhelmed by &lt;em&gt;How to Be an Antiracist&lt;/em&gt;. It didn't have clear takeaways for
me, though did introduce new-to-me ethical and historical context for living as an antiracist. It
feels cruel to compare this to similar works, as it is of course its own achievement and offers new
insights into race and racial tensions in America. But if I'm being honest I'd recommend a few other
books before this one. Definitely worth the time to read, but maybe give &lt;em&gt;So You Want to Talk About
Race&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Between the World and Me&lt;/em&gt; a try first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/southern-book-club.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plot twist: the real horror is misogyny! As you might guess from the title, this book is about a
group of housewives in Charleston who must slay a vampire that is targetting their children. What
you might not guess is that their husbands are the real monsters. I don't want to spoil too much,
but I will warn that the novel is graphic and disturbing (also as you might expect - just don't let
those cute peaches fool you!). The end was much less satisfying than I wanted it to be, but there
were a handful of scenes that stuck with me and made me shudder. This is a great September read to
get you in the spooky spirit, but get ready for your blood to boil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/rodham.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a word: &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt;. And strangely hollow. I recently heard a painter wax poetic about how eyes can
bring a painting to life or condemn it to a life of mediocre flatness. This book felt like a
painting with flat eyes. It avoided so much of the nitty-gritty political work Hillary has done and
focused on her friendships, romances, and work relationships, in a way that felt utterly un-Hillary.
The Hillary I know is all about the details, the specifics, the policies and plans, but this Hillary
was so focused on feelings and what people thought of her. I also felt like the triumphant tone the
book was supposed to strike was tempered by her lack of a life partner, not because being alone is
sad but because she seemed sad. Given the choice, I'm not sure she would choose to be President over
Chelsea and her grandchildren. I guess only she'll ever know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will say, the sex scenes were much less provocative and uncomfortable than others make them out to
be. Maybe my tolerance is high because I read so much romance, but c'mon people: everyone fucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book was glorious - mostly for the steaming gay romance, but also for the epic story and
gorgeous prose. I had the &lt;em&gt;pleasure&lt;/em&gt; of listening to the audiobook version narrated by Frazer
Douglas, whose voice is so deep and dusky it could be a canyon (and the accent! Wowza). This
&amp;quot;spinoff&amp;quot; of &lt;em&gt;The Iliad&lt;/em&gt; will be a special treat if you're into Greek history but is just as
compelling if you're not. I only knew the barest outlines of Achilles' story going in and didn't get
lost or bored at all. The book is narrated by - and largely about - Achilles lover Patroclus, who is
a deeply rich and interesting character. Patroclus' own history is much less widely known than
Achilles, so the story is new and interesting while still set in the familiar Trojan War
and traditional Greek mythology. The combination is both personal and historic, tragic and
heroic, and brings a new (to most) perspective to one of the most told stories of all time. I can't
recommend it enough!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RIYL&lt;/strong&gt;: Brokeback Mountain (the book), watching American Ninja Warrior just to watch hot people be
athletic, sword fighting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="these-witches-don-t-burn-4-5"&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/these-witches-dont-burn.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was everything I wanted &lt;em&gt;We Ride Upon Sticks&lt;/em&gt; to be: a group of high school witches who save
their small town! I loved the complex female friendships, the endearing and fiery characters, and
the mystery at the center of the book made it hard to put down. If you, like me, are looking for
some light witchcraft in your life 🔮 I highly recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RIYL&lt;/strong&gt;: Tarot, Josie and the Pussycats, collecting cool rocks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="only-mostly-devastated-4-5"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ollie was such a sweetheart! I loved getting to live in the world of this book for a few days.
Ollie's life is hardly easy - his crush is still closeted, his aunt is dying, he's forced to attend
a new school for senior year to be close to said aunt. But Ollie immediately connects with some
wonderful friends at his new school that most would call 'quirky' but I would call 'cool', and the
whole book has a brightly-colored quality to it. This was also one of the books where the characters
were great, but the plot was also fantastic (something I don't usually say). The conflicts weren't
contrived but were human and realistic, and the plot was well-paced and led to great character
growth.  Definitely one of the best YA books I read this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RIYL&lt;/strong&gt;: Glee, &lt;em&gt;An Absolutely Remarkable Thing&lt;/em&gt;,  wearing different socks on each foot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/writers-and-lovers.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What am I missing? This book is so acclaimed, beloved by the masses, and yet I found it boring and
unmoving. It's like a worse version of Stephanie Danler's &lt;em&gt;Sweetbitter&lt;/em&gt;. The prose is just fine,
the main character is a bit immature, and the love triangle is eye-roll-worthy. Overall the book is
fine in my opinion, but I wish I could see what made it &amp;quot;One of the best books of the year&amp;quot; for so
many other reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="i-wanna-be-where-you-are-3-5"&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/i-wanna-be-where-you-are.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a darling but forgettable YA romance, with cute but relatively untroubled characters and a
fun plot. Chloe wants to be a ballerina, but her mom forbids her from auditioning. So Chloe goes on
a road trip while her mom is away, but her neighbor Eli and his Schnauzer Geezer insist on coming
along. Hijinks ensue! This will definitely not make you want to be a ballerina, but it
will make you want to take a road trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/wedding-party.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually love Guillory's sassy characters and smart pairings, but these two just didn't do it for
me. That hate-to-love trope is one I sure do love to hate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="aristotle-and-dante-discover-the-secrets-of-the-universe-2-5"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12000020-aristotle-and-dante-discover-the-secrets-of-the-universe"&gt;Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe&lt;/a&gt;: 2/5&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/aristotle-and-dante.jpeg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly feel like something might be wrong with me for not liking this book. Maybe this shows my
callousness, but I just could not sympathize with Aristotle and Dante's disillusionment and angst.
Their philosophical musings felt both immature and unrealistic for teenagers, and their dialogue
felt very forced. I wanted so much to like this book, but ultimately it fell flat for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-happy-ever-after-playlist-2-5"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50208350-the-happy-ever-after-playlist"&gt;The Happy Ever After Playlist&lt;/a&gt;: 2/5&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/happy-ever-after-playlist.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bland characters who make &lt;em&gt;the dumbest&lt;/em&gt; assumptions about each other, and are painfully
heteronormative and tropey. The miscommunications are meant to move the plot along but are
impossible to sympathize with, making them more annoying than compelling. I gave up about halfway
through.&lt;/p&gt;

captivating, and uplifting, all in equal measure. The book is brilliantly broken down into 'What to
do', 'What not to do', and 'What more self-help books should advise', with each chapter covering a
'tenet' common to multiple books. Each section includes stories of how Kristen and Jolenta learned
and applied the tenet, detailing their often hilarious and interesting stories. It concludes with a
clear list of takeaways, and how you might apply the tenet to your own life. I loved that this book
was so well organized and full of personality. It's rare to find a book that's both
helpful and fun to read!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RIYL&lt;/strong&gt;: Call Your Girlfriend, Reese Witherspoon, actually helpful self-help&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="in-five-years-4-5"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;cite&gt;In Five Years&lt;/cite&gt;: 4/5&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/in-five-years.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Five Years&lt;/em&gt; burns slow, then happens all at once. I don't want to spoil it, but it's ultimately
about frienship and the unexpected turns life can take (as you might have gathered from
the blurb!). My main gripe with this book is that the title gives the impression that the main
character's life changes over the course of 5 years, but in reality the book skips 4.5 of those
years (literally there's a page that says &amp;quot;four and a half years later&amp;quot;). I wish it had just been
one year, or that the story had been drawn out over the five years more. With all of that said, I
thought the characters were great - of course I would, I can see parts of myself in both of the
young, ambitious, bright women at the center of the story (that sounds braggy now that I read it
back, and maybe it is). And honestly, for all the flaws of this book, I never knew what was going to
happen next and felt like I had to keep reading. This is a great book if you're looking for
something short and bittersweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RIYL&lt;/strong&gt;: TV shows where New York City is a character, Jodi Picoult,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake&lt;/em&gt; is, in a word, trippy. It's more of a vibe than a novel,
expertly weaving magic into reality that you don't realize it's magical realism until you're
halfway through. I appreciated the familial love that suffused every page, and the way this book
shook me out of my boring old world view. It was a refreshing, if sometimes confusing, change of
pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-garden-of-small-beginnings-2-5"&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/garden-of-small-beginnings.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This romance is mostly good for passing the time - there wasn't anything particularly good or bad
about it, it was just...pretty meh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/fix-her-up.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm embarrassed to say I finished this book. I needed a romance novel in my life at the time, an
escape from reality - and honestly, if &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; other book had been available at the library I wouldn't
have finished this. &amp;quot;What was so bad about it?&amp;quot;, you ask? The heroine in this romance novel is an
&lt;em&gt;aspiring clown&lt;/em&gt;. Aspiring. Clown. Unless you are also an aspiring clown - or are looking for a good
hearty &amp;quot;What the fuck is this&amp;quot; laugh - I suggest reading anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

amount of detail to be informative but not overwhelming. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40696975-work-optional"&gt;Work Optional&lt;/a&gt; is more of a workbook than
a novel, giving the reader exercises, algorithms, and concrete next steps to reach (or define) their
financial goals. It's your nosy aunt in book form: what &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; you want to do with your life? The
questions are gentle and guiding, and don't require strict answers - they're only there to be
considered, and to help you. The rest of the book is information on financial principles to help you
decide what's right for you. Do you need a health savings account? Should you be saving up for a
house? For example, I realized that planting more trees and providing better infrastructure for
biking are what I find most fulfilling, and that I should have health insurance coverage &lt;em&gt;along
with&lt;/em&gt; my HSA. No matter where you are financially I think you'll find this book useful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yowza! This book is so hot it might burn 😉. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44148563-love-her-or-lose-her"&gt;Love Her or Lose Her&lt;/a&gt; has an unusual romantic
premise: a husband and wife have lost touch, and work together to repair their tattered
relationship. There's so much to love about this book. Like so many modern couples they weren't
considering divorce for dramatic or scandalous reasons, but just because they had stopped
communicating and drifted apart. Unlike most couples, Dominic and Rosie are willing to put in the
hard work to fall back in love, documented throughout the book. Their sexual chemistry is &lt;em&gt;so hot&lt;/em&gt;,
and their vulnerability and development throughout the book are heartwarming and engaging. The
supporting cast is also fantastic, and I appreciate that these characters have full and vibrant
lives and ambitions outside of their relationship that makes them feel like actual people. Did I
mention that Rosie is a woman of color who opens her own restaurant? 10/10 must read!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/committed.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my fourth read of &lt;em&gt;Committed&lt;/em&gt; in anticipation of getting married this summer, and while
reading it came to realize our wedding would not be happening this year. I'm not sure if maturity or
quarantine (or both) changed my view of Liz Gilbert, but this time through &lt;em&gt;Committed&lt;/em&gt; rang just a
little more hollow. Maybe it's because I know now she's divorced Felipe, or because the prose reads
a bit more melodramatic than it used to. Maybe it's because I was &lt;em&gt;so excited&lt;/em&gt; to get married while
Liz was dreading it, which felt sad. Whatever the case may be, my shiny love for this book dulled
the tiniest bit on this reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="love-from-a-to-z-4-5"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a sweet and substantial modern teen romance. Adam and Zayneb could not be more different,
but they share important things in common: navigating being faithful Muslim teenagers in the US and
UK, the importance of family, and their love for Doha, Qatar, where the book is set. Like any
romance, I judged this book mostly on the richness of its characters, who were richer than a fudgy
brownie. I also loved the setting and perspective though, and the chance to better understand the
hate and prejudice Muslims contend with every day in America. It was heartbreaking. On the flip side
it was wonderful to read a book set in the Middle East, to better understand the culture and be
transported to where being Muslim is normal. &lt;em&gt;Love from A to Z&lt;/em&gt; was a fabulous teen romance with
depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book wasn't bad, it just wasn't for me. The grandeur of the narration felt overdone, the
symbology seemed random and meaningless, and the plot was hard to keep track of. I think this is
probably a great book that I just couldn't appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;em&gt;Waking the Witch&lt;/em&gt; I've been consuming all the witchy content I can get my hands on.
My excitement about &lt;em&gt;We Ride Upon Sticks&lt;/em&gt; quickly flamed out though. The book opens by introducing
an entire field-hockey team, 11 teens in total, and keeping track of all the characters
and their relations is harder than keeping up with the Kardashians. &amp;quot;Wait, which one is the Claw
again?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Who is Becca?&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Is Julie on the team or just a classmate?&amp;quot; pretty well summarizes my
thoughts while reading this book. The premise sounded so fun, I just wish I could have gotten past
the character overload and exposition to enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the narrow-minded opening poem to the confusing, abstract prose, I made it through barely half
of this short-story collection before giving up. I had such high hopes for this highly-rated
female-focused collection, but was completely turned off by the first piece and completely lost for
the rest. Maybe I just didn't get it?&lt;/p&gt;

birthday, which was fantastic despite being very different than we had

worst of winter behind us. Little did we know the world would shut down in mere
weeks. Here's what I read, in blissful ignorance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="things-you-save-in-a-fire-5-5"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41150382-things-you-save-in-a-fire"&gt;Things You Save in a Fire&lt;/a&gt;: 5/5&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is the modern romance I always hope to read but never quite get. The
heroine, Cassie Hanwell, is a firefighter who through personal and professional
circumstance has to leave her friendly Texas firehouse for an openly sexist,
old-school new gig in Boston. Highly accomplished characters tend to be
annoying and unrealistic - practically every high school graduate in literature
seems to go to Yale or Harvard regardless of how smart they actually are. But
Cassie is genuinely inspiring, both in her smarts, her calm during emergencies,
and her physical strength. She renewed my belief I could someday do a pull-up
(someday...in the future), at the same time being genuinely likable and flawed.
She's the absolute star of the book, and her crush on a fellow Boston
firefighter is downright adorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RIYL&lt;/strong&gt;: American Ninja Warrior, 'Miss Congeniality' before the makeover scene&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="nine-perfect-strangers-4-5"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39280445-nine-perfect-strangers"&gt;Nine Perfect Strangers&lt;/a&gt;: 4/5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liane Moriarty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/nine-perfect-strangers.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've read and loved Liane before - particularly her grittier works, like
&amp;quot;Big Little Lies&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;The Husband's Secret&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;Nine Perfect Strangers&amp;quot; may be a
bit disappointing. It has so many hallmarks of Moriarty's work: the
upper-middle class Australian setting, the complex and underestimated
characters (particularly women), the 'dramatic' final scene, though more of a
whimper than a bang. Luckily what I love about her books are the fabulously
compelling characters, which this had in spades (well...twelve of them at
least. &amp;quot;WHY NOT NINE?&amp;quot; You'll see). While NPS was a slow burn, I was strung
along wanting to know what would happen to the secretly lonely romance author,
the just-dumped soccer mom, and most of all the crazy Russian guru. Despite
the lack of plot there's mounting tension from the first chapter that keeps you
guessing until the climax, which honestly for me excused the disappointment of
that important scene. It's a great read, better if you don't compare it to the
author's other novels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RIYL&lt;/strong&gt;: Articles about Goop or Theranos, crystals, &amp;quot;Little Fires Everywhere&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another ensemble, multiple narrator read, my favorite part of &amp;quot;The
Authenticity Project&amp;quot; is that the plot never went quite where I expected. It
starts out like so many saccharine, feel good novels, and then morphs into
something entirely different by adding layers of complexity and nuance to each
character. Even the most sympathetic cast members are deeply flawed in the
end, and those who claim &amp;quot;authenticity&amp;quot; find it much harder to practice than
preach. This book also has a much more optimistic view of millenial culture
than some of it's Brit-fic contemporaries, which makes it less exasperating and
more balanced. It's hardly a 'must-read', but you won't regret reading it if
you panic-buy it at the airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RIYL&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39927096-less"&gt;Less&lt;/a&gt; (The book, not the word), &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34709995-the-lido"&gt;The Lido&lt;/a&gt;, 'Love, Actually', journaling&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/i-like-to-watch.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the prose of Nussbaum's essays is delightful, the content is sadly hollow
if you haven't seen (or closely watched) the TV shows she discusses. This seems
obvious in hindsight, but given I grew up watching TV about 10 years after
Nussbaum our cultural references and holy grail TV shows are just slightly off
from each other. For example, 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' was the show that
changed TV for Nussbaum, while I didn't see it until I was rewatching old shows
on Hulu earlier this year. Needless to say it had a different impact for each
of us. I think if you watch a lot of TV, and are either 30+ or were allowed to
watch The Sopranos before you were 10, this book will scratch itches you didn't
know you had. It'll make you rethink the shows you love, give you a new
perspective, and put the show in it's cultural context. But if you're not? Your
time is better spent watching 'The Good Place' (EVEN IF YOU'RE A BOOK PERSON
NOT A TV PERSON TRUST ME).&lt;/p&gt;

novels, what &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; I like? This book made me question who I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While chick lit rarely claims to be realistic, this book is pure fantasy. It's
not unpleasant but it is distracting, like a superhero movie with bad CGI. When
baseball all-star Gavin Scott learns his wife (and mother of his 2 daughters)
has been faking orgasms for years he's understandably upset, though more about
his ego than about her. The fight breaks their already strained relationship,
and the rest of the book follows him trying to fight his macho instincts and
win her back. In general I like the arc of rebuilding a broken relationship
more than the hate-to-love trope, but the characters weren't especially likable
and the whole book reeked of gender norms. The worst part of the book was it's
conceit: a group of male pro-athletes who read romance novels and teach each
other how to treat women based on those romance novels. The bit wouldn't be so
bad if it was written more honestly, and less like an Adam Sandler movie- &lt;em&gt;Isn't it soooooo ridiculous to think of grown men reading romance novels? Hahaha&lt;/em&gt; 😐.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may be harshing the mellow too much - this book was below expectations, but
overall was a perfectly vanilla modern romance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a very long, citation laden way of saying &amp;quot;Go outside&amp;quot;. It's
central question is captivating: &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; is nature so good for us? But the dearth
of answers is unsatisfying - we only know all the ways in which it's good for
us, but it's hard to determine precisely why. For example we know,
✨scientifically✨, that the smell of eucalyptus and lavender are calming, but
can only guess at why those plants cause that reaction in our brains. I'm all
about the message of the book, and about making access to nature a right and
not a privilege. But honestly, I read this a month ago and cannot tell you one
thing I remember from it.&lt;/p&gt;

Stage&lt;/a&gt; by Bryson, I felt betrayed by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9791.A_Walk_in_the_Woods"&gt;A Walk in the Woods&lt;/a&gt;. Firstly I do not
care for Katz, Bryson's ill-prepared and impulsive companion, at all. I do not
understand why Bryson tolerated his irrational decisions, lack of endurance, or
very presence at all. More than Katz, this book is missing what I love so much
about Bryson's other books: fascinating stories doused with his own brand of
insight. The book felt two-dimensional compared to &amp;quot;The Body&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Shakespeare&amp;quot;,
merely an account of what happened instead of a commentary on nature and the
human spirit. You're better off reading the appropriately more famed &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12262741-wild"&gt;Wild&lt;/a&gt; by

&lt;p&gt;This was an exceptional, if not life-changing, romance novel. A big-shot movie director, Jo Jones,
begins to fall for her googly-eyed assistant Emma. I'm a sucker for anything set in SoCal, but even
for those who aren't the plot is thick with interest. The public eye never sleeps in this book, and
the characters have to handle intense pressure throughout their relationship. Not only that, but the
power imbalance between boss and employee raises questions about whether they even &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; get
together. The conflicts in &lt;em&gt;Something to Talk About&lt;/em&gt; are organic and compelling, while also being
new since I'm certainly not famous enough for anyone to care about who I kiss (if you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; that
famous OH MY GOD HI!). The result is a fantastic FF romance read that will certainly sweep you away,
while also providing some real substance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RIYL&lt;/strong&gt;: La La Land, Ali Wong, celebrity memoirs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my goals in 2020 was to read a sci-fi book, mostly to try a new genre and hopefully read
some fresh, new ideas. I was honestly dreading it, having started-and-stopped many sci-fi books for
being too toxically masculine, too confusing (so much jargon), or just plain boring. &lt;em&gt;The Long Way to a
Small, Angry Planet&lt;/em&gt; had me doing a complete 180 on sci-fi as a genre. The multi-species cast was
brilliant - rich, hilarious, empathetic, and...is it weird to say &amp;quot;realistic&amp;quot; about a species that
communicates through the color of their cheeks? I realized that a lot of sci-fi takes itself &lt;em&gt;so
seriously&lt;/em&gt;, and this was a breath of fresh air. It still covered serious topics, like workers'
rights, classism, and grief, but with healthy doses of levity throughout. The world was intricate
and interesting without being too complicated (I never had to keep track of what a Zerborgler was),
and the story was interesting enough to keep reading without being so &amp;quot;thought-provoking&amp;quot; you can
only read it in small doses (as so much sci-fi tries to be). This was a fantastic read for sci-fi
novices and veterans alike - I liked it so much I got two people this book for Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RIYL&lt;/strong&gt;: Music Festivals, road trips, being anti-capitalist, otter pops, calling coffee &amp;quot;java&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;joe&amp;quot; or other silly names&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/lamb.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciated this book, but it wasn't for me. First, I definitely don't have the Christianity
knowledge required to understand all the jokes. I have Level 1 Bible knowledge: Mary Magdalene,
Noah's Ark, Lazarus, all that good stuff. But idk who tf Balthazar is, or if he's even in the Bible
and it's an elaborate joke or if he's just a weird character in this story? The jokes that did land,
like Biff accidentally inventing the latte, were also not exactly my sense of humor. I appreciate
the premise of the book and think it certainly deserves its high rating on Goodreads. I'd readily
recommend it to a number of friends. It just wasn't for me.&lt;/p&gt;

Christmas parties, drinks with friends who were in town, family gatherings, and
one Harry Potter themed dinner, we ate enough free cookies to last us all year.
It was wonderful to see everyone, catch up with old friends and make new ones,
and it's so nice to remember what we value most: the people in our lives. We
both tend towards working too much, and even on break I can feel myself itching
to be productive. This season is always a reminder that our value isn't in our
work or productivity, it's in our relationships with family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the busyness I read &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; this month, mostly in an effort to reach my
100 book goal by the end of the year (which I did!). Some are shorter books,
but what helped me read so much was that so many of them were fantastic,
mind-blowing, life-changing reads (plus a lot of re-reads). Mostly I think I
got lucky that several holds I'd had for months came in at the library at the
same time. It made December reading a delightful escape, and ended the year
with a literary bang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="burnout-5-5"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42397849-burnout"&gt;Burnout&lt;/a&gt;: 5/5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emily Nagoski and Amelia Nagoski&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/burnout.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2 words, Burnout is about women and stress. It starts out by explaining
what, physiologically, stress is, and why we evolved to be stressed. As we were
evolving we would be stressed for short periods of time, then &lt;em&gt;complete the
stress cycle&lt;/em&gt; by coming down from stress and recovering from it in a variety of
ways. We weren't meant to be stressed for long periods of time, and a big
problem with modern stress is that we don't complete the cycle and de-stress.
The book then talks about a variety of common stressors and how to manage them,
from small things (drink more water) to bigger life changes (move so your
commute is shorter). The whole book is crowded with research and study
citations, many of them by the author Emily Nagoski herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I loved about this book is how compassionate the authors are. They wrote
the book after each experiencing extreme stress in different ways (Amelia was
hospitalized), and they wanted to help other women manage their own stress
based on what they've learned about it. The tone of the book was warm, and of
course the data and science was thorough without being dry. After reading this
I've started to make sure I see friends more often and talk about what on my
mind, and am starting to identify when I'm stressed and take notes. In the era
of commercialized self-care this may seem like just another product tryin to
get a piece of the pie, but it's genuine and actionable. I've already got it on
hold to reread it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note: The audiobook was narrated by the authors, who are twins! They
alternate chapters, and hearing it in their voice made the book hit home that
much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RIYL&lt;/strong&gt;: Brene Brown, Radio Lab, putting too many things on your todo list&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could listen to Lindy West read a phonebook, and I'm sure she'd make it equal
parts funny, insightful, and inspiring. West's debut book &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29340182-shrill"&gt;Shrill&lt;/a&gt; introduced
me to fatphobia, and the idea that our concept of beauty is enitrely learned
and contrived by companies. I can't say I overcame or even confronted my own
relationship with my body and food, and my anxieties around being fat.  But I
did start to think that the pressure to be thin was manufactured, and realize
my worth wasn't tied to my weight. 'The Witches Are Coming' has the same smart,
witty tone that 'Shrill' did, with a slight pivot in topic to feminism in
modern culture. West covers #MeToo, Trump, abortions, misogyny, racism, and
more with humor and intellect, and her writing is riveting and inspiring as
always. This book felt like it was written &lt;em&gt;for me&lt;/em&gt;, in it's references, and
subjects, and points of view. I found myself chorusing 'Amen' after every
single chapter - whether you already agree with her and want a rallying cry, or
don't agree with her and are wrong, you should read this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RIYL&lt;/strong&gt;: Reading, happiness, pizza&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read 'The Santaland Diaries' every year around the holidays, an irreverent
tradition, and it never fails to make me laugh and get me in the holiday
spirit. My favorite part is the elf-training David suffers, followed closely by
Snowball the flirty elf. If you haven't had the pleasure I highly recommend the
seasonal treat, particularly the audiobook which is narrated by Sedaris
himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wowza this book was 🔥🔥🔥. A thinly veiled Harry Styles fan-fic, 'The Idea of
You' follows Solène as she meets and romances Hayes Campbell, an ultra-famous
boy band member. Every scene is laced with sexual tension, and about 40% of the
book is fantasy-inducing sex scenes. I only read about 2/3 of the book, until
I could tell conflict was brewing, then stopped. But those first 2/3s were
&lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RIYL&lt;/strong&gt;: Call Me By Your Name, forbidden romance, The Weeknd&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never the Veronica Mars TV show or movies, but knew the premise and that
I'd be apt like it. Since so much of what shines in Veronica Mars is the
dialogue, the books are (I'm guessing) a bit toned down from the wit and
snappiness of the show. But I can definitely see why it's done so well -
Veronica is witty but flawed, and the mysteries are interesting without feeling
contrived. It was easy to listen to both these books over 3 days, and I hope
they come out with more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Christina Lauren&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty classic modern romance novel. Assumptions are made, lack of
communication causes conflict, hate-to-love. It was wonderful to escape dreary
December and read about Hawaii for a few days though, and I did like and root
for both the hero and heroine. Enjoyable but unremarkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rainbow Rowell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reminded me so much of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33107351-george-and-lizzie"&gt;George and Lizzie&lt;/a&gt; in that it was about a
middle-aged couple who's relationship had hit the rocks and forced them to
reflect on how they met in the first place. The main characters were also
mostly similar in the demeanor (though with meaningful differences - I'm not
accusing of plagiarism!), and the story followed a similar format of flashing
back. This book was sweet if not great, and while I wish that the heroine had
gotten together with her best friend instead of her husband I suppose that's
just how some books go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Douglas Adams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly appreciate that this book is funny, and get why it's part of the
zeitgeist. I think I was just too stressed to enjoy the silly humor, and even
then that it just wasn't quite for me. I'll still quote it just as much as
before though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frederik Backman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think I got this book...it was supposedly a heart-warming Christmas
novella, reminiscent of 'A Christmas Story'. A wealthy man who has dedicated
his life to making money is confronted by death, and rethinks his priorities.
It was a little too poetic for me though, and the story between the lines got
fuzzy for me. Ultimately it was forgettable and just kind of weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To say I was skeptical going into this book is an understatement. I've never been the least bit
spiritual, disbelieving everything from western religions to burning palo santo, and certainly don't
believe in witches or know very much about paganism. This book isn't trying to make you believe
anything though - it reframes what the term 'witch' means, and traces it's history through western
culture, from it's beginnings in Paganism to the Salem witch trials to portrayals of witches in
modern media. The thesis is that a 'witch' isn't a green hag with a wart on her nose, she's an
independent and self-sufficient woman who is close to nature and understands things most people
don't, and &lt;em&gt;that's&lt;/em&gt; what makes her scary. That hit home for me, and made me completely rethink my
conception of what witches are. I also loved the exploration of witches through culture, and learned
so much about witches relationship with Christianity that I was immediately able to connect to my
real life (mostly because we're currently watching the new 'Sabrina', and 'Buffy the Vampire
Slayer'). The prose is incredibly well written, the author's points are nuanced and well rounded,
and the topic is enchanting (forgive me). A must read!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hot damn&lt;/em&gt;. I can't wait to watch this movie after reading the novella. Much like Elio and Oliver's
attraction in &lt;em&gt;Call Me By Your Name&lt;/em&gt;, Ennis and Jack's romance is inevitable and preternatural. It's
intense and irresistible and &lt;em&gt;sexy&lt;/em&gt;, the kind of connection I'm sure I'll never experience but like
to think still exists. And the &lt;em&gt;landscapes&lt;/em&gt;. Ugh. I'm dead. Honestly this book is so short, I'd
recommend reading it whenever you're in the need for a pick-me-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; what I expected at all, but was a delightful detour from the typical rom-com
novel-scape. Laurie and Jack's romance is anything but typical, starting with a fated glance on a
bus and following them through romances, engagements, friendships, breakups, huge life changes, and
&lt;em&gt;drama&lt;/em&gt;...mostly with other people. What I liked most was that all of the characters were
three-dimensional, all likeable and unlikeable in their own ways. Everyone was fallible and human,
without being annoying or unrealistic. A lovely seasonal read!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RIYL&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0314331/"&gt;Love, Actually&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098635/"&gt;When Harry Met Sally&lt;/a&gt;, slow-burn love stories&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read this in an attempt to scratch the Christmas-itch I caught early in the month, and it almost
did the trick. The true story is at once sad and heartwarming, and while the prose reads more like
a news article than a novel (not surprising, considering the author is a journalist!) it's simple,
factual descriptions are surprisingly expressive. I thought I'd like this more than I did, but I
can't put my finger on what I didn't love about it. In the end it was just ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/one-snowy-night.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never been a huge fan of Shalvis' books, but I wanted a short and steamy Christmas-themed
romance. This delivered, but also reminded me how much I don't like tropey hate-to-love,
heavily-gendered romance novels (which....is most of them). Would not recommend unless you're really
into that sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/christmas-at-little-beach-street-bakery.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colgan's novels are consistently like popcorn: light, airy, easy to eat by the handful, but not
terribly satisfying. I read this during a stressful week and it was nice to have it on as background
noise, but as with her previous novels the characters are only sort of likeable, and the conflicts
were contrived and silly. It held my interest until the end, but I think if I had been having a
better week I wouldn't have even picked this one up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't know the author, so while this was an interesting perspective on life growing up in
Yugoslavia I found it hard to be invested in the author's story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Christmas candy read, this was a tame romance with a weird premise. The hero talks a woman he
knocked up into keeping the baby, with no desire to marry her, and then when she gives the baby up
for adoption he take the baby instead. I generally liked the idea of a newly single-father with a
baby as the hero of a romance novel - so vulnerable! - but the way we got there was unsettling. That
aside, I like the main characters, and the conflicts between them, and the 'hate' bit of hate to
love was minimal so even that tired trope didn't bother me as much as usual. As romance novels go it
was enjoyable but forgettable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, this book was ill-fated from the start. I read it for a book club &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; after getting
engaged, and was resentful of having to read such a sad book during such a happy time in my life.
I heard after reading it that it was originally a screenplay that was meant to be a movie, but
didn't make the cut so got turned into a book, which makes &lt;em&gt;complete&lt;/em&gt; sense. The characters are flat
and somewhat simple, while the scenery descriptions and plot are more rich. Honestly...I'd recommend
about 10 other concentration camp books before this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read instead&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1617.Night"&gt;Night&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39999.The_Boy_in_the_Striped_Pajamas"&gt;The Boy in the Striped Pajamas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19063.The_Book_Thief"&gt;The Book Thief&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21853621-the-nightingale"&gt;The Nightingale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

campaign (not as DM, just playing!), and of course went to a pumpkin patch. Everything we did was
fun, and the weather in Portland was &lt;em&gt;gorgeous&lt;/em&gt;. It's been a beautiful, wonderful, spooky October,
and I'm admittedly sad to see it end. I'm also looking forward to Thanksgiving and more time with
family though, so can hardly complain. This month's books were, overall, not great. I've maxed out
my holds at the library and books are taking FOREVER to come in now (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://p2a.co/fgcQkzV"&gt;fuck publishers&lt;/a&gt;), so I'm
ending up with books that happen to be available a bit more. Anywho, here's what I read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="jane-steele-4-5"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25868918-jane-steele"&gt;Jane Steele&lt;/a&gt;: 4/5&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/jane-steele.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite not having read Jane Eyre (which the novel is inspired by and frequently references) I found
I connected a lot with this book, and mostly with it's heroine. Jane Steele, as her name suggests,
is a strong-willed and righteous murderer - though she only murders &lt;em&gt;horrible&lt;/em&gt; men who have wronged
the women in their lives! So...it's kind of ok. She's like a 19th century English Dexter, although a
bit more sympathetic. What I liked about Jane was how strong her relationships in the book were -
her complex friendship with her best friend Clark, her protective instincts toward those who help
her, and ultimately her love interest. Jane reads like living in the mind of a real person, with
doubts and convictions and feelings all expressed throughout the book. It was fun to live in her
crazy and curious world for a while, and I'd definitely read a sequel!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Courtenay Hameister&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/okay-fine-whatever.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly...this title feels appropriate. I wanted to like this more than I did, especially after
reading about how hard Hameister takes criticism (I'm sorry!). But the book just didn't resonate
with me. As someone with very mild anxiety I thought I could connect to someone overcoming their
fears, and in Portland OR no less. It turns out Hameister and I don't share the same anxieties or
coping mechanisms, and throughtout the book I mostly just thought &amp;quot;Oh thank God I'm not her&amp;quot;. Don't
worry, she gets a happy ending, and the book isn't as much of a downer as I'm making it out to be.
If you are experiencing anxiety, or evaluating making a change in your life, I think this book would
be more meaningful. It just wasn't for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a sweet but forgettable rom-com read. Nina Hill is an almost-great character, a cliche
bookworm who struggles with her love life. What I liked most about Nina was what a strong network of
female friends she had. From coworkers to her trivia team, Nina was introverted without being
isolated. I also liked that the conflict in the book was both realistic....and towards the end a bit
silly and off-the-rails 🙂. If you're looking for a palate-cleanser or an easy read, this is a fun
one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved the thesis of this book, my only complaint was that it was hammered home a few too many
times. And for good reason, since most of us spend our &lt;em&gt;entire childhoods&lt;/em&gt; learning that math is
rigid, and strict, and hard. Cheng aims to break that misconception by demonstrating how math is
creative and fun, how it's about breaking the rules of math and seeing what happens (like with
imaginary numbers). She attempts to rebuild our understanding of what math is from the ground up
using metaphors and real-world scenarios, and illustrates her points beautifully. This is a
fantastic book for a teen or pre-teen wondering why they need to be in math class, or for anyone
looking to add a little more math to their day-to-day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a lot to like and appreciate about this book, but not a lot to love. This is classic Ann
Patchett: a deeply human story about a perfectly normal family that, when you examine closely, isn't
so normal. Her characters and their relationships are so rich, described exclusively through 'show'
and not tell which gives them quirkiness and specificity that's downright delightful. I also love
the span of her book - you get to be with the characters as they develop and change from childhood,
a sort of built-in character growth that isn't forced. I have mixed feelings about how little plot
there was - I liked the smaller mini-stories through the book, and that the focus was so heavily on
the characters, with the entire &amp;quot;plot&amp;quot; spoiled halfway through the book. With all that's to like
about the book though, I didn't find myself deeply invested in the characters. They were fine, but I
wasn't dying to read each next page. I guess that's how many of Patchett's books are, but it still
keeps this one from being a 5 star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book was not intended for me. Firstly I've never listened to 'Wait Wait Don't Tell Me', so
while I vaguely knew Peter Sagal I was hardly a fan. Secondly I'm already an avid runner, and the
book was intended for this looking to get into running. The book is part memoir about a person I'm
not invested in (who assumes you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; invested in him - you did pick up his book afterall), and
part argument for why you should start running, which...I already am. So, I didn't get a lot out of
it. Also I found out about 2/3 of the way through that he's remarried to someone who is 18 years his
junior, and while I know that love is love and I'm sure she's great or whatever it just creeped me
out and I couldn't keep listening. Call me judgmental, you're not wrong. Anyway, I'm not sure I'd
recommend this book to anyone. I'd say you should read &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6289283-born-to-run"&gt;Born to Run&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;

about sadness, or drugs, or poverty, let alone all three in one book. I could only stomach about
half the book before giving up. The reality of the book isn't very pleasant to live in, and while
there are plenty of uncomfortable books that are worth powering through and considering deeply I
didn't feel like I was getting anything out of reading this. That's not entirely true - I think it
gave me some understanding of what it's like to be poor in America, to deal with mental illness and
have no support system. But...then a book I wanted to read more (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42202046-waking-the-witch"&gt;Waking the Witch&lt;/a&gt;) came in and I
gave up on this one. I'm sure I'm a worse person for it, but also a happier one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was definitely a small step up from the last novel of Dave's I read, &lt;em&gt;Hello Sunshine&lt;/em&gt;. I
appreciated that the central conflict of the book isn't just &amp;quot;Will she get the guy?&amp;quot;, but was about
her career and direction of her life. The heroine was relatable and imperfect, and the story did a
good job of exploring the messiness and complication of real life without having such a heavy &amp;quot;novel
facade&amp;quot;, which I think tends to skim over those details. Her parents relationship in particular
resonated with me, as it was neither a fairytale nor a nightmare but a regular old marriage, full of
compromise and heartache and love. I doubt I'll remember much about this book a few months from now,
but for a short time it was a good book to escape into.&lt;/p&gt;

serendipitous qualities. I loved each of the main characters, who are lovely
and kind Midwesterners but also complex and layered people. I love how slowly
their stories unfold, taking time to include important and character-defining
details and telling the story right. I loved the themes and plot, and the
general world that Stradal creates. I highly recommend!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For such a terrible cover, this was a great novel! Tiffy and Leon were both
wonderful characters, and while the plot was a bit predictable it also wasn't
boring, and kept me wanting to read more. I loved how endearing and real both
characters were, and how I was genuinely rooting for them. I thought their
flaws made them human, and I empathized with them both. One of the better
rom-com novels I've read this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still haven't read the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36199084-the-kiss-quotient"&gt;The Kiss Quotient&lt;/a&gt;, Hoang's acclaimed first novel,
but somehow this second in the series found it's way to my library playlist
first. I see now why &lt;em&gt;The Kiss Quotient&lt;/em&gt; was talked about for months! &lt;em&gt;The
Bride Test&lt;/em&gt; follows Esme Tran as she leaves her mother and small daughter in Ho
Chi Minh city for the opportunity to travel to America to go on a blind date
with a wealthy woman's son. Khai has high-functioning autism, and is initially
cold to Esme's attempts to win his heart. But over the summer, in a sudden plot
twist, they &lt;em&gt;gasp&lt;/em&gt; fall for each other. Though predictable this book was
charming, and I loved both characters. They were genuinely annoying at times in
a way that was refreshing - they weren't coyly avoiding each other, and there
were no plot devices super obvious plot devices to drive them apart. Their
strife was genuine, and so their affection felt more genuine. I already have
&lt;em&gt;The Kiss Quotient&lt;/em&gt; on hold as well, and can't wait to read more in this
wonderful series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hit home just how uncool I was in high school. The book centers on three
teenagers, two who are Pakistani Muslim and one who is Indian-Pakistani. The
book explores complex issues in a way that respects their complexity, looking
at it from multiple sides and trying to understand the layers and opinions of
each player. For example one teenager is closeted gay and Muslim, with devout
parents. He grapples with his religion, hating it for making his parents hate
gays but also loving God and finding comfort in the rituals and community. What
I liked most about this book was the perspective it gave me, living the world
of southeast-asian teenagers in the modern age, and the constant daily
expectations and judgments they face from the public and their own community.
It was also a relatively light and fun read, and the friendship between
protagonists is wonderful. An excellent teen adventure book with a little more
weight to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/waiting-for-tom-hanks.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this book was always ill-fated for me since...I don't &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; Tom Hanks.
He's a great actor! And I love &lt;em&gt;Forrest Gump&lt;/em&gt;. I have nothing against the man
personally. But when I think of my favorite actors, particularly those I lust
after, Tom Hanks is pretty low on the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was Annie's pining for Hanks that felt unbelievable then. Or the fact
that a movie star would fall for a lamer version of Bella Swan, if such a thing
is possible. In the end I only made it maybe 1/3 of the way through before
giving up. It wasn't among the worst books I've ever read, but definitely
wasn't worth my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="i-might-regret-this-3-5"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38902427-i-might-regret-this"&gt;I Might Regret This&lt;/a&gt;: 3/5&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/i-might-regret-this.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having just watched all of &amp;quot;Broad City&amp;quot; this summer, I had no idea Abbi had
written a book until I came across it at Powell's. I liked the book because I
love Abbi, and already care about her as a person. But I don't know that on
it's own it would be a great read. The memoir follows Abbi on a road trip she
took between the 4th and 5th seasons of the show. It's full of classic Abbi
Jacobson humor and overthinking, while also being vulnerable and talking about
her insecurities and fears. It was, on reflection, an excellent balance of
reality and humor, of candor and levity, but for some reason it just didn't
resonate with me. I think I don't empathize with a lot of Abbi's fears, and so
they felt sad and pitying rather than joyous in finding I wasn't alone in those
fears. That said, the book is very well written, and if you do share her
tribulations and enjoy her humor it will be a fantastic read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mitch Prinstein&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/popular.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this research heavy book, Prinstein advocates that feeling accepted and
acknolwedged by your peers has a lot of positive outcomes, including longer
lifespan, greater professional success, higher reported happiness, etc. He
describes 5 categories of popularity that people fall into: average, accepted,
neglected, rejected, and controversial. While where you fall on this spectrum
is largely based in genetics and early childhood, Prinstein suggests that we
have more control over our standing on the spectrum than we may realize. He
argues that trying to become more likable, as opposed to gaining status via
wealth or power, will win you friends. This was like a very research driven
version of &lt;em&gt;How to Win Friends and Influence People&lt;/em&gt;, and while it was
interesting I'm not sure I'll remember very much of the book a month from now.&lt;/p&gt;

We visited friends in Corvallis, and my extended family in Bend, OR. We celebrated a one year anniversary with a big backyard barbecue, and a birthday with a hike and picnic brunch. Literarily the month was less great - I chose what I thought would be fun and easy, summery books many of which just turned out to be plain bad. If there's one thing I've learned from reading so much this year, it's that there are a lot of bad books that get published. I guess 'bad' is too generic a term though, and who am I to say a book is bad? I suppose it's better to say books I can't appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what I read in August:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="fleishman-is-in-trouble"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41880602-fleishman-is-in-trouble"&gt;Fleishman Is in Trouble&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taffy Brodesser-Akner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/fleishman-is-in-trouble.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After listening to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/06/the-cut-on-tuesdays-podcast-taffy-brodesser-akner-fleishman-is-in-trouble.html"&gt;an interview with the author&lt;/a&gt; I was overly hyped about
this book (which I guess is the point of interviews). The protagonist, Toby
Fleishman, is bizarrely (though apparently not overtly) reminiscent of Toby
Flenderson from &amp;quot;The Office&amp;quot;. He's limp and pitiable, and seems to know it. His
noodleness is directed not just outward but inward too - he doesn't like
himself, but is too noodly to do anything about it. Being on the opposite side
of marriage I can't bear to read about bad experiences with it - I'm too
jealous that they even got married in the first place, and mad that they've
gone and fucked it up. It's irrational, but between that and an intentionally
not-quite-likeable protagonist, I just couldn't power through. I think if
you're interested in interpersonal relationships, or are going through divorce,
this will resonate with you. Otherwise I don't think the book quite stands on
it's own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="juliet-s-school-of-possibilities"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40641078-juliet-s-school-of-possibilities"&gt;Juliet's School of Possibilities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/juliets-school-of-possibilities.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was overall a nice book, if heavy-handed with the parable. The book
follows Riley Jenkins, who starts out struggling to hold together her job and
relationships. She attends the 'school' of Martha Stewart-esque homemaker /
life coach, who tells Riley:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
 Expectations are infinite.
 Time is finite.
 You are always choosing.
 Choose well.

I liked the moral of the story, though can't say it's changed my life since
finishing the book. Riley's whole life turns around the course of a few pages
after beginning to implement this lesson, which I think is just a concession
you have to make to the book. The author explains in a post-script that she's
a time management coach who had so many conversations with people like Riley,
and wrote the book to spread the same message she tells her clients. A quick
and healthy dose of self-help, but not a must-read.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="naturally-tan"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/"&gt;Naturally Tan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tan France&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/naturally-tan.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! The &amp;quot;Queer Eye&amp;quot; fashion expert you know and love wrote a book, in case you
didn't love him enough already. Tan (are we on a first name basis? I hope so)
is such a gem. His narration is so sassy, and his book balances serious stories
with fun and funny moments. The book reads like a conversation, and it was fun
to get to know Tan better as a human. His perspectives on fame, culture, and of
course fashion all gave me new ways of seeing the world. It broke my heart
hearing about his childhood as a Pakistani in England, and how he was bullied
and beaten up regularly just for being brown. Even today TSA regularly pulls
him aside for 'random search', and he has to represent all of southeast asia in
the media because that group is so underrepresented on TV. If you love &amp;quot;Queer
Eye&amp;quot;, this is a must read!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS I highly recommend the audiobook - there's a special guest appearance in the middle of the book and that's all I'll say!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="natalie-tan-s-book-of-luck-and-fortune"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42051103-natalie-tan-s-book-of-luck-and-fortune"&gt;Natalie Tan's Book of Luck and Fortune&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/natalie-tans-book-of-luck-and-fortune.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oof. This was too YA to even be a YA book. The book was mostly the narration of
the protagonist telling us about her feelings, instead of expressing them or
showing them. She comes to realizations - sometimes the wrong realizations -
without any prompting or events to help her realize them. The book and narrator
have a flat worldview where everything is good or bad and way oversimplified,
making it intolerably unrealistic and uninteresting. I gave up halfway through,
and don't regret it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="meet-cute"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41063454-meet-cute"&gt;Meet Cute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/meet-cute.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggressively generic and flat story - which didn't even have a good meet cute!
This PG-13 romance stars 2 lawyers, at first rivals from law school who then
become friends and then lovers all while she is a conservateur for his little
sister in a custody battle with his aunt. The characters were one-note and
remarkably dumb, and read more like the exaggerated characters from a kids
movie than adults. The plot was slightly better though the pacing was jerky,
spending lots of pages on the boring parts then wrapping up the interesting
bits in only a dozen pages. In hindsight I
should have given up halfway through on this one as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="hello-sunshine"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27274420-hello-sunshine"&gt;Hello Sunshine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/hello-sunshine.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a sweet and satisfying book. It follows youtube cooking celebrity
Sunshine Mackenzie's (real surname: Stevens) fall from grace, which forces her
to move back home and realize what she sacrificed for fame. I love that it
focused on a woman's career, and was filled with strong women who weren't
talking about who to marry. It was an interesting plot, and while the
instagram-is-terrible 'moral' was a little heavy-handed it made sense
narratively. This was a great chick lit, summer read!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a cultural disconnect between me and &amp;quot;Southern Lady Code&amp;quot;. It didn't
help that I went in with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cupofjo.com/2019/05/best-books-spring-2019/"&gt;high expectations&lt;/a&gt;, and have never even visited the
south. The book felt of another era to me - hilarious and rebellious if you're
a 50's housewife and have all the expectations therein placed on you. The
chapter on deciding not to have kids read as revolutionary, and while it's sad
and terrifying to think that for a lot of women that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; revolutionary and
courageous for me....it isn't. &lt;em&gt;Shrug&lt;/em&gt;. I think southern ladies will get a kick
out of this book, but for me it was a miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might be the only person on earth that had never heard of Ruth Reichl or
&lt;em&gt;Gourmet&lt;/em&gt; before picking up this book, and I &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; it. Ruth is a natural
storyteller, describing people and experiences in technicolor detail. It feels
like you're &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;, in Paris enjoying dizzyingly good food, or in the cramped
elevator with Anna Wintour wondering what she's thinking. The book is so warm,
and Ruth's love for Gourmet is in every word of this memoir. I can't wait to
read her other writing - in the meantime this must be on your TBR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/evvie-drake-starts-over.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a solidly ok romantic read. I like the gentle and realistic way that
Evvie and Dean's relationship evolves, and that their conflicts didn't feel
constructed or fake. I liked that they weren't your typical perfect
hero-and-herione, and that there wasn't a fairytale ending where everything ~
magically ~ works out. At the same time there wasn't a lot that stood out about
the book - it was a cute summer read, nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="between-the-world-and-me"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25489625-between-the-world-and-me"&gt;Between the World and Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/between-the-world-and-me.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What an incredible read. Like much of Coates' work it's poetic and profound, and for a white girl like me eye-opening. The book is about race in America, and Coates' personal history with experiences and explorations of it. From his rough, impoverished Baltimore childhood to studying at Howard University to visiting a Civil War memorial with his family, Coates' lyrically describes his own realizations about being a black man in America. This was one of my favorite passages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
Slavery is not an indefinable mass of flesh. It is a particular, specific
enslaved woman whose mind is as active as your own, whose range of feelings
as vast as your own, who prefers the way the light falls in one particular
spot in the woods, who enjoys fishing where the water eddys in the nearby
stream, who loves her mother in her own complicated way, thinks her sister
talks to loud, has a favorite cousin, a favorite season, who excels at dress
making, and knows inside herself that she is as intelligent and capable as
anyone.

Slavery is the same woman born in a world that loudly proclaims its love of
freedom and describes this world in essential texts. A world in which these
same professors hold this woman a slave. Hold her mother a slave, her father
a slave, her daughter a slave
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was initially interesting book, but got long towards the end. It's the
story of Abbigail, a single-mom who's brother has been missing for 20 years.
There are many interesting mysteries that slowly come to light, but one is
revealed way too fast (if you ask me) and the other way too slow. I thought it
was a sweet read, but was ready to move on to other books about 3/4 of the way
through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was such a refreshing and smart YA read. I loved the voice and
confidence of Emoni, and loved how real the story, conflicts, and
characters were. It didn't feel overdone or dramatic, and it was
unexpected yet realistic how casual Emoni was about having a baby, and
how much she loved her baby. Highly recommended for young adults and
old adults alike!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Garden Party&lt;/em&gt; reminded me of Gabriel Garcia-Marquez' &lt;em&gt;100 Years of
Solitude&lt;/em&gt; in terms of it's atmosphere and eccentricity. The book is dreamy and
fantastic, firmly in reality but just at the edge of it, and I liked that it
was electric without veering into zaniness. Despite liking the vibe of the
book, I'll admit I started to get a bit lost in jumping between conversations,
and gave up entirely on it when it came due at the library maybe 3/4 of the way
through. If you liked &lt;em&gt;A Mid-Summer Night's Dream&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;100 Years of Solitude&lt;/em&gt;,
you'd like this modern tale too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gretchen Rubin seems like such a happy, lovely person, and I enjoy reading and
listening to her just for a dose of happy-go-lucky. That said I find I never I
actually follow her advice. I thought this book would make me want to purge and
clean, but instead found that I was already pretty happy with the state of my
posessions - probably because we had just moved, so had already &amp;quot;Kondo'd&amp;quot; our
things. I gave up halfway through in pursuit of more interesting reads (per
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gretchenrubin.com/2014/07/13-tips-for-getting-more-reading-done/"&gt;Gretchen's own advice&lt;/a&gt;!), but if you like Gretchen as I do then you'll like
her latest research project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book &lt;em&gt;hit the spot&lt;/em&gt;. It was so cute and fun without being too sugary or
saccharine, with great characters and interesting conflict (if a bit crazy). If
you liked &lt;em&gt;Miss Congeniality&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Legally Blonde&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;The Princess Diaries&lt;/em&gt;,
this is the perfect beach read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was not ready for the intensity and emotional depth of this book. What I
thought would be yet another romance novel was a fantastic novel about the
reality of abuse, and in particular being abused by a famous professional
athlete. Time and again athletes get a mere slap on the wrist for abusing their
partners, and this book highlights just how powerless both physically and
socially those partners are. Don't get me wrong - there were also plenty of
great sex scenes with a non-abusive partner, and a lot of the typical
over-simplification of emotions and sex that romance novels are known for. But
this book gave me a better understanding of what abuse victims suffer, and as
terrible as this sounds an appreciation for the men in my life. If you like
Colleen Hoover, or want a typical romance novel with way more grit and
emotional twists, then this is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an intense read this was a refreshing palate cleanser. I'll use the back-of-the-book summary:
.. line-block:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
Having just been dumped by his girlfriend, British-born Hugo is still
determined to take his last-hurrah-before-college train trip across the
United States. One snag: the companion ticket is already booked under the
name of his ex, Margaret Campbell. Nontransferable, no exceptions.

Enter the new Margaret C. (Mae for short), an aspiring filmmaker with big
dreams. After finding Hugo's spare ticket offer online, she's convinced
it's the perfect opportunity to expand her horizons
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a whimsical and adorable coming-of-age, young-love story. It was fun
without feeling meaningless, and captured that summer-crush teenage-romance
feeling without feeling overly romanticized (high school wasn't &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; great).
Highly recommend if you're looking for a quick and fluffy read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ayesha-at-last"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43124133-ayesha-at-last"&gt;Ayesha at Last&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uzma Jalaluddin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/ayesha-at-last.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book helped me realize how intolerant I am of religion - almost certainly
too intolerant. I like to think of myself as 'live-and-let-live', and I would
&lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; tell anyone else what to believe or how to be. But listening to the
thoughts of truly devout people was uncomfortable, and I found it took a lot of
character development for me to like the more religious characters. Because of
this, and because of the portrayal of modern struggle between religion and
culture and modernity, I thought this was a great book. Ayesha is a strong and
likable character, and while I wasn't rooting for her love interest I was
rooting for her, which kept me hooked. A great combination vegetable-candy book
(or as I like to think, a fruit book), you'll like this one if you liked
&lt;em&gt;Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Bend it Like Beckham&lt;/em&gt;. In fact....I
think I'd recommend you just read &lt;em&gt;Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows&lt;/em&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;

listening) now that I'm commuting, so here's what I've been reading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="america-for-beginners"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35098009-america-for-beginners"&gt;America for Beginners&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/america-for-beginners.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was an endearing, heartwarming, unexpectedly melancholy novel. It
follows an Indian widow - rid of her isolating, emotionally abusive
husband - on her search for her gay son in America. The adventure of
course goes sideways, and is full of cultural conflict, examining
prejudices, and realizing that we're all similar. An uplifting read -
but be prepared with tissues at the end!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="i-remember-nothing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8242117-i-remember-nothing"&gt;I Remember Nothing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/i-remember-nothing.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My latest Nora Ephron, I found this one was hard to connect to. It's
all about her experience of aging, and I felt the generational
disconnect. I'd love to pick this up again when I'm 40 or 50, but for
now it just felt melancholy and foreign, and made me afraid of getting
older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/mirror-shoulder-signal.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one didn't quite do it for me either. It's about a 40-something
Danish woman struggling to move on from a rough childhood. It's sparse
on details though, and I found Sonja's anxieties and murky past hard
to read about. It's simultaneous distressing and not terribly
interesting, and felt weirdly empty of both plot and characters. In
the end I moved on to more enjoyable reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="swearing-is-good-for-you"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40180029-swearing-is-good-for-you"&gt;Swearing is Good for You&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a long-form podcast, this was a super interesting and well
written book! It looks at swearing from every angle - why we do it,
how it's changed over time, how it affects our brains. Everyone swears
or has opinions on cussing, so it's definitely relevant to your life
and makes for great conversations with just about anyone. It's
scientific yet accessible - at one point the author even cites her own
paper! Some of my favorite learnings are that monkeys will create new
words from the words they know which resulted in them calling radishes
&amp;quot;cry food&amp;quot;, and that calling someone's mother a &amp;quot;das Schwein&amp;quot; (pig) in
Germany is one of the most offensive curses (like, actually &lt;em&gt;do not
say it&lt;/em&gt;).  If you listen to a lot of science podcasts or like
nonfiction this is a great read!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-life-less-throwaway"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming off of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13330588-happy-city"&gt;Happy City&lt;/a&gt; I wanted to know more about reducing the
waste I produce - not just in trash, but in buying things I don't need
or use. This ended up being too much preaching for me. Despite the
authors helpful, actionable exercises, the well researched and planned
solutions to the social problem of buying too much, I found I wasn't
getting very much out of it. It was geared toward someone who was more
skeptical and 'early' in their own-less journey, and honestly I also
just didn't love the narrator of the audiobook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-lido"&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/the-lido.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book was solidly fine. It's way too nostalgic, and heavy-handed
in prescribing the kind of society we should live in. If you love
reading articles about how millennials and cellphones are ruining
everything, this is a great book for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't. That said, the characters are endearing and the plot is
somewhat interesting. It's got a YA vibe in that every personality and
event is heavily simplified (in fact it's more YA than a lot of the YA
books I read...), and the whole book felt one-dimensional. But if
you're looking for an easy, mostly-uplifting read, this'll do the
trick :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="not-the-girls-you-re-looking-for"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have mixed feelings about this one. It was more solidly YA than many
of the &amp;quot;YA&amp;quot; novels I read, and it reminded me of all the best and
worst parts of high school. Lulu is a biracial Arab-American Muslim teen
(her mom is a white American Catholic, her dad an Iraqi Muslim) living
in Texas, and it was interesting (and heartbreaking) to read about her
experiences of racism and struggle with her own cultural identity. She
has a wonderful and dramatic group of friends who have their own
struggles - one Hispanic, one lesbian, one with helicopter parents -
and while their fights felt petty they were also realistically high
school. I love the perspective this book gave me and the complexity of
the characters, if not the complexity of their boy problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another true YA read, this had a similar vibe to the previous one -
heavy on the boy troubles, but also on the well-written characters
with interesting struggles. 'Tell Me Three Things' follows Jessie after
her mom dies, and her dad moves her from Chicago to LA to live with
his new wife (about 2 years after her mom dies). While the plot itself
is predictable Jessie's grief and coping with the loss of her mom is
palpable, and every character is dynamic and well-written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I LOVED this book. After a lot of so-so books it's so refreshing to
read a book that reminds you why you love to read. The book starts in
modern day when 90-something Isabelle asks her close friend and hair
dresser Dorrie to drive her to a funeral in Cincinnati from their home
in east Texas. Isabelle tells Dorrie about falling in love with a black
man in 1939 in Kentucky, in parallel talking about Dorrie's own modern
life as a black single mom raising 2 kids and dating. The characters
were so rich in this book, and before I knew it I felt so invested in
knowing what would happen next. I laughed, I cried, I gained so much
appreciation for the privilege I have as a white woman living in
modern day. My first 5-star in a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was some lovely lighter fare while I travelled to Budapest for
work. It follows four women who, through a hilarious and unlikely
series of events, find themselves in a book club together despite
knowing very little about each other. From there the real antics
start: accidental affairs (the affair part is accidental, not the
sex), a bathtub falling through the ceiling, party favor vibrators,
and a big secret. I liked the complex female friendships in this - how
the 4 don't always get along but find that their lives are better
together than apart, and how in the end they're there for each other.
This is a fun and exciting beach read!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the first collection of Nora Ephron essays I read, and while
it was fine it didn't live up to my expectations. My favorite movie
while growing up was 'When Harry Met Sally', and as a young woman
trying to understand my own femininity and place in the world I
thought Ephron would be perfect for me. Instead her essays felt dated
and boring - I found I didn't connect much with her magazine habits
and beauty trend adventures. I wasn't completely turned off, and can
see the great writer beneath the fluffy topics. She's sharp and
confident, and able to describe the things you know intimately but
could never quite find the right words for. As you'll see this didn't
turn me off of Ephron altogether, but it's not what I'd recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is the Nora Ephron I expected. While still a collection of
essays this set was much more reflective and autobiographical. Ephron
discusses everything from beauty standards to food trends to finding
an apartment in New York, and while her references and tone felt dated
I loved reading about a passionate, working mom who wasn't victimizing
or complaining, but observing and appreciating (but also without being
goody-goody? I think only people from New York can pull this off).
I feel like I'm describing it very well, so I'll just say: if you like
WHMS, give this one a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Author's Note&lt;/em&gt;: I've also got Ephron's &amp;quot;I Remember Nothing&amp;quot; in my
queue, but it'll have to wait until May&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very overrated. I had high hopes for this one - I thought it'd be a
mystery for us library lovers, a thrilling profile of the man who set
the Los Angeles Central Library on fire and why, as well as a love
letter to libraries themselves. It was both those things yet was
&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; unsatisfying. I found Harry Peak was not an interesting or
compelling villain, and that gushing about libraries was more like trying
to convince me libraries were great. I kept thinking &amp;quot;I already agree
with you &lt;em&gt;where do you think I got this book?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;. Don't believe the
hype - listen to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.myfavoritemurder.com"&gt;My Favorite Murder&lt;/a&gt; instead, or show your support
for libraries by getting a different book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodness gracious I had a severe case of overhype this April. Maybe
it's me, or maybe there just weren't that many new books to gush
about....regardless, I thought this was the worst of the overhyped
reads, and perhaps also the most hyped. Everyone is talking about
Sally Rooney, and I &lt;em&gt;do not get it&lt;/em&gt;. Her characters are moody and
don't make sense, their interactions are brief and tense. The book
felt grey and depressing, the novel equivalent of a mid-January day. I
suppose that's the appeal, but it's not for me. I'd see the movie if
they made it with Saoirse Ronan, but besides that I think this is it
for me and Rooney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/queenie.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I liked most about this book was how it snuck up on you.
Throughout the book Queenie finds herself in increasingly terrible
situations, and often centering on her being an overweight black woman
in the UK. It begins with a breakup with her loving boyfriend, and
spirals from there to getting raped (and not feeling like she could
say no to a man she was flirting with) to having a miscarriage and
losing her job. Told from her perspective though the reader
understands every decision she makes. This book helped me understand
what it's like to be a woman of color, and how the things we judge
people for (how could you have a miscarriage and not know the father?)
are in reality nuanced stories and could easily have happened to us. I
loved that Queenie never felt sorry for herself, yet how she called
out racist and sexist policy and behavior when she saw it. This book
changed how I see the world and understand blackness in the UK/US -
can't recommend highly enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="happy-city"&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/happy-city.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life changer alert: this book has &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; changed my life. It's
not an earth-shattering, ground-breaking kind of book but
definitely the right book read at the right time. As Eli and I
move back to Portland we've been thinking about how to 'shape' our
lives there. This book focuses on the design of cities and how city
planners can help make their residents happier, but throughout are
things residents can do to make their cities and communities happier.
Reading this really drove home that Eli and I don't want to own a car
(see what I did there?) and that we should structure our lives in
Portland around not owning one. It got us thinking about how we spend
our time and our money, what things are important to us, and what our
goals are (not suburbia!). On top of all that, the book was
well-researched and well-written, and held my interest the whole time.
Highly, highly recommend (especially if you're moving or have another
big change ahead in your life!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not usually one for sad books, particularly at such a stressful
time in my life. This one captivated me though, and the first-person
descriptions of having multiple sclerosis were vivid and haunting. I
loved the main character's voice and perspective - the everyday battle
against her own body, and not wanting to be a victim but still needing
help. Her narrative gave me empathy for people with MS and other
illnesses, and helped me see that people aren't defined by their
illness or disabilities. I also loved the narrators disorientation,
and thought the first-person perspective of fear and helplessness
(even when it wasn't due to her MS!) was visceral. This was also a
great audiobook! A tough topic, but 100% worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="george-and-lizzie"&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/george-and-lizzie.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book didn't really come together for me until the end. It was
pretty ho-hum, a perfect slightly-boring antidote to my
crazy-hectic-moving-to-Portland life at the moment, but nothing to
write home about. It's a slow burn, but all the low-lying conflict in
the book builds to a crescendo at the very end that makes the
characters and this long-winded story rewarding. It shows the
complexity and variability of relationships over time well. It's about
coming to terms with your past in order to be happy now, and about
living in the Midwest, and about what it means to have a happy
marriage. I thought this would be another disappointment on my list,
but by the end I was riveted! Tentatively recommend, if you can make
it 5/6ths through a boring read.&lt;/p&gt;

wouldn't get through all the books I did try for as many as I could
that were available at the library. This resulted in a slow month with
a lot of 'vegetable reads' - novels that I think are good for me, as I
wouldn't normally read them and they broaden my horizons. It was also
a great reminder of why I don't read books strictly based on acclaim
very often. A few gems were found though: let's get into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="warlight"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36723246-warlight"&gt;Warlight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/warlight.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't usually the type of book I'd pick up, and honestly
reminded me why I don't read 'artsy' books as much. While I can see
the appeal of Ondaatje's ethereal settings, elusive characters, and
vivid setting descriptions, it's weird to dedicate so many words to
the strange details of a story (the dog race scene? What?) instead of
the plot or characters. I suppose that's the appeal - it just isn't
for me. Ultimately a good book, and good to get out of my comfort
zone, but I won't be coming back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="census"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068746-census"&gt;Census&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/census.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ha! And I thought 'Warlight' was artsy. 'Census' was way too abstract
for a casual reader such as myself. While I wouldn't say this was a
'bad' book, and the Author's Note provided some much-needed and heart
wrenching context, it was not for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-italian-teacher"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31937362-the-italian-teacher"&gt;The Italian Teacher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was by far my favorite of the ToB reads. I loved Pinch's
complicated relationship with both of his parents, and how that shaped
so much of his life. It captured so well how desperate we are to be
shown love by our parents, who are supposed to love us
unconditionally. How despite being rejected and ignored and
unsupported repeatedly by his father, Pinch still longs for his
acceptance even at the cost of success in other areas of his life. I
loved how messy Pinch's life was, how each event made sense on it's
own but together created a story that felt unlikely and wild. If you
like stories about family dynamics, coming of age, or the art world,
this one is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="surprise-me"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2770407672"&gt;Surprise Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/surprise-me.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was (appropriately) surprised by how much I liked this book! I
expected it to be a meaningless fling of a book, the kind of thing you
read when there's nothing else to read. The depth of the heroine's
character, the plot twists and gut wrenches in her story, and the
relatable setting all made this a very enjoyable read! I wouldn't go
so far as to say I loved it, or it changed my life or anything. I'm
not even sure I'd recommend it. But I would definitely not discourage
people from reading it, and hope you'll also find it entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a lady software engineer, I thought a romance novel with this title
could not disappoint. Apparently I learned nothing from 'Big Bang
Theory': tech-themed media is &lt;em&gt;so hard&lt;/em&gt; to get right. While the
technical details of the book are pretty good, the characters fall
totally flat. The heroine gives all appearance of being a 'strong
female lead', then ends up falling for a guy who's clearly beneath
her? I didn't really get it - Jeremy was a mostly-loser, and she could
have done &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; better. Skip this sorry feminist-wannabe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last of my ToB reads, I think it's most telling that my library
loan expired halfway through reading this and I didn't renew it.
Like 'Census' it wasn't a &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; book (will I ever say a book is a bad
book?), but I didn't feel invested in any of the characters. I didn't
understand the charm of the main hero, who hypnotizes an entire
community into doing his bidding, or the sense of loyalty the leading
lady felt for him. It was hard to care about what happened to anyone,
and - I can't believe I'm saying this - focused way too much on the
character dynamics and not enough on the plot. It was hard to
understand what was happening from such a narrow perspective, and I
admittedly can't read between the lines. Overall, this book was just a
bit confusing and not all that interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

Best Man Win&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10047589-girls-in-white-dresses"&gt;Girls in White Dresses&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30038862-walking-to-listen"&gt;Walking to Listen&lt;/a&gt;
before finally making it all the way through &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35297416-laura-emma"&gt;Laura and Emma&lt;/a&gt; (which
was honestly just okay).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite some truly terrible reads, February was a wonderful month!
Well, mostly our &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.lucywyman.me/hawaii-2019.html"&gt;trip to Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; was wonderful. The rest of the
month was spent hoping it wouldn't snow then trapped inside by the
snow. I'm ready to move to LA. It's fine. Here are the few books I
actually made it through this month!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="royally-matched"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29991718-royally-matched"&gt;Royally Matched&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emma Chase&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/royally-matched.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35271238-a-princess-in-theory"&gt;A Princess in Theory&lt;/a&gt; last month, this was a
disappointing return to typical romance novels. Based on the modern
royal family, the book was utterly predictable and I didn't love
either of the protagonists. Can't say I'd recommend it, but I didn't
have anything better to read and it was a quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="dietland"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22749796-dietland"&gt;Dietland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sarai Walker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/dietland.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have really mixed feelings about this book. Having struggled with
anxiety about my body since I was a teenager I thought that a
body-positive read would be good for me. In some ways it was - it's a
fantastically feminist read about learning to love yourself and accept
yourself, including the gross, teary-eyed, hard struggle it takes to
get there. But when the feminism turns violent, and the
self-acceptance gets extreme, the books kind of lost me. I found it
emotional, and confusing, and wasn't sure whether I loved the message
or whether the message was that things can only change through
rejecting society and violence. It was definitely interesting food for
thought, and worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="laura-and-emma"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35297416-laura-emma"&gt;Laura and Emma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kate Greathead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/laura-and-emma.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I powered through this after a drought of good books, and liked it
more by the end than I did in the beginning. It's about a single
mother raising her daughter in blue-blood New York City through the
80's and 90's, and was charming but not a &lt;em&gt;must read&lt;/em&gt;. I thought I
would identify with Laura and her progressive values more than I did,
and while she was empowering and self-reliant and imperfect, I didn't
feel compelled to know what happened to her. I liked Emma as a
character a lot more, and enjoyed how her personality changed as she
aged. Overall, I think this was a great book that just didn't resonate
with me as much as I wanted it to, but I think it may resonate with
others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-immortalists"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30288282-the-immortalists"&gt;The Immortalists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chloe Benjamin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/the-immortalists.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FINALLY, in the last days of the month, I found a book to remind me
why I love to read. This novel opens in 1969 when 4 siblings visit a
fortune teller in their neighborhood, who is rumored to be able to
tell you the day you'll die. The rest of the book follows each of the
siblings, and how the prediction affects them and their lives. I loved
how different each of the siblings is, and their various takes on the
prediction. Each character is slightly romantic and very vivid - they
felt more like people you knew than characters in a book.  It's not
quite 5 stars, but I chewed through this thick book in 3 days and
can't recommend it enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know March is typically &amp;quot;In like a lion and out like a lamb&amp;quot;, but
spring came early for me and February's books were in like a lion and
out like a lamb. Hopefully this literary sunshine continues!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've got our big trip to Oahu coming up week-after-next (we fly out
February 12), and I think both of us are delirious with anticipation.
We've both started to feel burned out, and I know a week of doing
nothing in the sun will do us both good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month's literature had it's ups and downs. There wasn't anything
I &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt;, but then I think reading some just-ok books gives me an
appreciate for the gems. This post is long, so without further ado
here's what I read in January:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="eleanor-park"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15745753-eleanor-park"&gt;Eleanor &amp;amp; Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rainbow Rowell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/eleanor-and-park.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed this book for the same reasons I think many readers enjoy
it. I loved how real Eleanor and Park were - how they were truly
awkward teenagers, trying to figure life out, and how fast and deeply
they fell for each other. It brought back a lot of fond memories of my
high school years. I was captivated by their family dynamics, and
found it was &lt;cite&gt;moreish&lt;/cite&gt; - I wanted to keep reading every chance I
got to find out what would happen. Highly recommend if you're looking
for a modern love story, coming-of-age, and misfit teens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-last-mrs-parrish"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34043643-the-last-mrs-parrish"&gt;The Last Mrs. Parrish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liv Constantine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/the-last-mrs-parrish.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoiler alert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; enjoyed this book, though didn't quite love it. I wish
that the husband had died in the end - I definitely thought that's what
&amp;quot;The Last&amp;quot; part of the title was. But I enjoyed reading about strong
women taking down a horrible man. I thought Amber and Daphne were
both well-written, layered, mostly sympathetic characters, and the
changing perspective in the story was &lt;em&gt;fantastic&lt;/em&gt;. I totally didn't
see it coming! And then I was HOOKED. Not quite 'Gone Girl' level, but
an exciting thriller with lady leads.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="south-and-west"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32842454-south-and-west"&gt;South and West&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joan Didion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/south-and-west.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first Joan Didion experience, and while I found the
subject revolting I thought her style of writing was some of the best
I've ever read. The way she's able to step outside of the time and
place she's describing and include details that at the time must have
seemed insignificant but which, reading it now, stand out and give so
much color and depth to her travels! Her language is rich, her
attention to detail is limitless, and her perspective is funny and
real and honest. I continue to &lt;em&gt;loathe&lt;/em&gt; the deep south and everything
it stands for, but fell in love with Joan Didion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tuck-everlasting"&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/tuck-everlasting.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reread this for the first time since reading it as a tween, and
loved it just as much. It's so sweet and nostalgic in the way reading
YA is, and I the moral of answering the question of 'why things die'
really resonated with me. I'm among those that thinks on my mortality
often, and I always worry that I'm not making the most of my life.
&amp;quot;Tuck Everlasting&amp;quot; reminded me that to have unlimited time would be
even worse, and that death can be both scary and a natural part of
human life. It made the prospect of dying less terrifying, and told a
lovely story along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-place-for-us"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36840397-a-place-for-us"&gt;A Place for Us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/a-place-for-us.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book wasn't for me - I don't think because it was a bad book, but
because it was &lt;em&gt;so boring&lt;/em&gt;. I made it halfway through before giving up
for greener pastures. I found I just didn't care at all about any of
the characters, and was only occasionally enraged at the injustice of
the gender norms. I think writing in third-person is hard like that -
while I appreciated the switching perspective, and stories from each
character, I never felt like I knew any of the characters.  The
timeline is difficult to keep track of, and there's just no depth to
anyone in the story. I just couldn't muddle through such a big book
of nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-red-car"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34082140-the-red-car"&gt;The Red Car&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/the-red-car.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised by how much I liked this novel, both while reading it
and on reflection. I think it was exactly what I needed at this time
in my life. It's about reflecting on your life so far, trying to
figure out what you really want, and letting life just tumble you
along instead of trying to control it for a time. I loved the dreamy
quality of the book, and how the author writes each of the main
characters thoughts out in such a realistic way, like how she keeps
forgetting then re-realizing that she took time off of work. That's SO
MUCH how I think, and I've never read that idiosyncrasy captured in a
character so well. I liked the mystery of the car, and that it was
never really solved. I honestly kind of liked that there wasn't a lot
of resolution. It felt very California, very outside of time and
place, very akin to how the character felt in their life. I wouldn't
call this my favorite book of the year, but I'm surprised in
reflecting on it how much I enjoyed living in Leah's head for a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="early-work"&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/early-work.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I almost forgot to include this in the monthly update, which I think
sums up pretty well what I thought of it. This was the most mediocre
book ever. I wouldn't even say it was &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; - there was nothing to
dislike about it because there was nothing to think about it. Some
writer who is SO full of himself treats people around him like
garbage, and gets away with it, and everyone acts like it's normal as
always happens. The girlfriends both take it in stride and continue
living their way more interesting and successful lives, dragging him
along for god knows why reason. He's not even philosophical, or
creative, or interesting. He's a mashed potato sandwich dipped in the
hot sauce of casual misogyny. Actually, now that I'm writing about it,
maybe I &lt;em&gt;didn't&lt;/em&gt; like this book, and just kept reading for the dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="truth-and-beauty"&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/truth-and-beauty.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ann Patchett's descriptions are unparalleled. She paints such a vivid
picture of her friend, describing her physicality and interactions so
well you start to think you know Lucy. Her re-telling is wonderful in
how she's able to remember what it was like to experience the story at
the time, as well as in retrospect. I remember her describing 9/11,
and saying &amp;quot;At the time that's how we thought of them: missing&amp;quot;. That
kind of perspective is so hard to cultivate, and she does it
seamlessly. This is a beautiful and heart-breaking story of
friendship, and it's trials and tribulations and rewards and
adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month was mostly meh, with several books that were enjoyable
enough to see through but that I wouldn't necessarily recommend. I
&lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;Eleanor Oliphant&amp;quot;, despite having put it down halfway through
6 months ago, but other than that I can't honestly rave about any of
my other reads. So, I suppose this is a list for is you have
absolutely nothing better to read. HAHAHA as if that ever happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's to starting off the new year with better books!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="eleanor-oliphant-is-completely-fine"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31434883-eleanor-oliphant-is-completely-fine"&gt;Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/eleanor-oliphant-is-completely-fine.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely my favorite read this month, I put &amp;quot;Eleanor Oliphant&amp;quot; down
last May, deciding I didn't care for the protagonist or plot. If only
I had read 50 more pages! I won't give away any spoilers, but will
only say that you should power through at least 1/2 the book before
giving up on it. More is revealed about Eleanor that makes her a much
more palatable character, and by the end you'll be literally crying
for her. At first it seems like a book about a stuck-up loner with a
horrible mother, but later you'll find themes of loneliness,
judgement, depression, and trauma. A must read!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="if-you-come-softly"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36076595-if-you-come-softly"&gt;If You Come Softly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jacqueline Woodson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/if-you-come-softly.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read this as part of John Green's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.lifeslibrarybookclub.com/"&gt;Life's Library&lt;/a&gt; project, and
have mixed feelings. It's short enough that I'd consider worth the
investment of time and energy, and I wholeheartedly understand and
endorse it's status as an important book which has remained remarkably
relevant for 20 years now. I may not have liked it, but it was a good
book for me to read and reflect on. I also liked that the focus wasn't
&lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; about race, but that both characters were complex and layered,
and race was just one part of their multi-faceted identity. I know the
book is based on &amp;quot;Romeo and Juliet&amp;quot;, but it was a little hard to get
over the love-at-first-sight thing, and felt the use of poetry was
heavy-handed. It made the book unnecessarily angsty, and distracted
from the prose. Lastly I &lt;em&gt;hated&lt;/em&gt; the end. I'll try not to spoil it
here, but it felt like an attempt to &amp;quot;save&amp;quot; the book or give it more
meaning than it could have otherwise. While realistic, it felt like a
way of avoiding writing more character development, and actually
following through on the protagonists relationship. Ok, dangerously
close to spoilers, so that's all I'll say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="late-bloomers-club"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36952311-the-late-bloomers-club"&gt;Late Bloomers' Club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some words to describe this book:
Fine
Cute
Relaxing
Forgettable
Shrug&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-princess-in-theory"&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/a-princess-in-theory.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was nearly the perfect romance novel. The smart, capable heroine!
The sensitive, supportive hero! SHE PEES AFTER SEX TO AVOID A UTI! I
really enjoyed this book - the plot was interesting and exciting, the
characters were endearing, and it addressed social issues particularly
around sex head on. The perfect modern romance, if you ask me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/sisterland.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I wouldn't recommend this book. I made it to the end, and it
was good enough that I wanted to know what happened, but there's much
better literature and characters out there (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25852870-eligible"&gt;Eligible&lt;/a&gt; by the same
author being a good example!). My main complaint is that the narrator
doesn't abide by a set of principles, and while I think there's a
place for flawed narrators and protagonists this one was &lt;em&gt;so annoying&lt;/em&gt;
and spineless. She doesn't take her family's best interests into
account, and reveals herself to be selfish and weirdly obstinate on
certain issues while flexible on others. I was too far in by the time
all this happened to put the book down, but I honestly have no
sympathy for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read this before giving to my dad as a Christmas present, and was
surprised and delighted by how entertaining it was. It attempts to
examine Shakespeare's life, but because so little is known about him
ends up being more about the time-period and context he lived in. I
don't generally care for history, but thought this was fascinating and
at time hilarious. Who knew the Puritans living in Elizabethan England
were so wily? Or that a rival theater group literally &lt;em&gt;stole a
theater&lt;/em&gt; and rebuilt the building on the other side of the river?
Highly recommend this short and fun read!&lt;/p&gt;

great in terms of literature. I had a lot of of stops-and-starts this

then found I didn't want to pick up or finish. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36098092-florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; by Lauren
Groff, an author I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; I don't enjoy yet insist on giving a new
chance every few months. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36344555-all-we-ever-wanted"&gt;All We Ever Wanted&lt;/a&gt; by Emily Giffin, which
sounded interesting but just felt like too much after hearing so much
about the election. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40961230-the-travelling-cat-chronicles"&gt;The Travelling Cat Chronicles&lt;/a&gt; by Hiro Arikawa,
which just wasn't my cup of tea. A lot of half-read and unopened
novels on the shelf this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But! It was a fantastic month besides. I helped run a tech conference
early in the month, and got to spend time with wonderful people whom I
don't see enough of. Thanksgiving was perfect; my parents joined Eli's
family for the big meal, and it was the best weekend of relaxation,
food, good company, laughter, and joy that I can remember having in a
while. And through it all, here's what I was reading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="you-me-everything"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36077170-you-me-everything"&gt;You, Me, Everything&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/you-me-everything.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like I should have liked this book more than I did. There's
nothing about it I &lt;em&gt;didn't&lt;/em&gt; like - I enjoyed the main characters, felt
like they developed and changed in interesting ways, and the
information reveals throughout kept me reading. It just fell a little
flat, for whatever reason, and was more sad than I was anticipating
(in a good way!). &lt;em&gt;Shrug&lt;/em&gt;. I hope they make it into a movie, because
it's set in the South of France and I think would be visually
&lt;em&gt;stunning&lt;/em&gt; and emotional in real life rather than a novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="erotic-stories-for-punjabi-widows"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32075853-erotic-stories-for-punjabi-widows"&gt;Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/erotic-stories-for-punjabi-widows.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved this book! I found each character's story so compelling, of
course loved the strong cultural and feminist tones, and thought the
mystery kept things interesting and timely. This was very nearly a
perfect Lucy book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-pun-also-rises"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10115296-the-pun-also-rises"&gt;The Pun Also Rises&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/the-pun-also-rises.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one might not be for everyone, but I've recently taken an
interest in wordplay and enjoyed the wit and humor in this book. It
is, of course, full of puns and approaches the subject of wordplay and
language development with curiosity and whimsy. But it also details a
(euro-centric) history of how wordplay was culturally perceived, and
important moments and characters in the development of the pun. A
great gift for the english major in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="to-love-jason-thorn"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26184918-to-love-jason-thorn"&gt;To Love Jason Thorn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/to-love-jason-thorn.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides 'little one' being THE WORST pet name in the history of
romance novels, this is a pretty good romantic read. It's not a
hate-to-love trope, which already puts it in like the top 10% of
romance novels. And on top of that there are interesting and very
realistic conflicts around relationships amid fame, and romance with your
brothers friend. This was a layered read that was really more a great
rom-com with steamy sex scenes. As long as you can get past 'little
one', which I would understand if you couldn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-proposal"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37584991-the-proposal"&gt;The Proposal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/the-proposal.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another book I thought I would like more than I did. Diverse
characters, a strong, sassy, independent female lead with an equally
strong-willed and compassionate male lead. The conflicts were totally
believable, the story was cute and compelling. All the elements are
there! I'm not sure why I wasn't head-over-heels for this modern
romance, but for whatever reason it was just ok for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

fiction and a small dash of self-help. I also just got about 9 books
in from the library all at the same time, so am looking forward to
spending the weekend curled up with some tea and a lot of books!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick aside: did anyone else follow the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.pbs.org/the-great-american-read/home/"&gt;Great American Read&lt;/a&gt; series
by PBS? I loved the diversity of their list of 100 books, and while I
was disappointed that Harry Potter didn't 'win' it was a fun series to
follow along with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what I couldn't put down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="sadie"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34810320-sadie"&gt;Sadie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/sadie.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll admit I'm not the most perceptive consumer when it comes to
mysteries and thrillers. I &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; see the twist coming, and am putty
in the hands of the author / director. 'Sadie' was no exception, and I
&lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; this YA thriller. The main character, Sadie, was amazingly
layered and unique, and I loved reading the story through her voice.
Her narration is also juxtaposed with a journalist telling the story,
and I appreciated that it didn't feel like the 'storytelling within
storytelling' crutch was used too much. His narration felt genuine,
and gave you both a new perspective on the story and little dribbles
of new information along the way. I was so wrapped up in hearing the
end, I literally got to work 20 minutes late this morning because I
&lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to finish it. Highly highly recommend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="an-absolutely-remarkable-thing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24233708-an-absolutely-remarkable-thing"&gt;An Absolutely Remarkable Thing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hank Green&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/an-absolutely-remarkable-thing.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I adore the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/vlogbrothers"&gt;Green brothers&lt;/a&gt;, and while I wouldn't consider myself
part of the fandom I consume a lot of their content, including reading
John Green's books growing up. As such there was a lot of hype around
Hank publishing a book, and I was excited not just to read the book as
a book but to read something that someone I kind of care about in a
celebrity type way wrote. It felt more personal somehow than just
reading any-old book. I don't know why I didn't expect the book to be
great, but I didn't, and &lt;em&gt;hot dog&lt;/em&gt; was I impressed. Hank's debut novel
is amazing. I love his protagonist and narrator, April May, who is
layered and human and flawed but very likeable. I loved the commentary
on fame, and how fame changes you and what the experience of fame is
like. I loved the whimsy of the sci-fi / mystery robot plot. I loved
the voice of the novel, the funny throw-away lines and how unique each
characters way of thinking was. I can't recommend this book highly
enough, whether you're 13 or 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="where-d-you-go-bernadette"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="#where-d-you-go-bernadette"&gt;Where'd You Go, Bernadette?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/whered-you-go-bernadette.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I liked this better than Maria Semple's previous books, I
wouldn't say you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to read it. It's a sweet story about a
dysfunctional family (who live in Seattle - it was so fun to recognize
all the place names!) and the crazy antics and adventures the family
finds themselves in. It's being turned into a movie, and while I can't
say I resonate well with the characters I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think this will look
great on screen. It was a fun read, and could be a fun film - that
alone makes it worth reading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="from-the-corner-of-the-oval"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36758503-from-the-corner-of-the-oval"&gt;From the Corner of the Oval&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/from-the-corner-of-the-oval.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was pleasantly surprised by this book - not because I thought it
would be bad, but because I thought it would be different. Rather than
focusing on the political insight and intrigue of working directly
with the President, 'From the Corner of the Oval' focuses much more on
Beck's personal life, as well as her incredible experiences as part of
White House staff. It reads more like a memoir than an episode of the
West Wing, and while some may find this disappointing I read &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt;
of myself in Beck's story. I loved hearing her struggle to find a
sense of identity, to earn respect in a tough job, and to find meaning
in her work. She's a talented writer with a fascinating story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="hyperfocus"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36959766-hyperfocus"&gt;Hyperfocus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/hyperfocus.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was expecting this to be a kind-of-dumb self-help book, telling me I
wasn't disciplined enough or whatever and that if I was just &lt;em&gt;more
focused&lt;/em&gt; then I could focus better. It's actually a great, data-driven
book that includes exercises for improving focus and the science
behind them. The author is also humble and grounded - he doesn't claim
to have all the answers, or that every exercise will 'cure' you
somehow. He encourages the reader to try each exercise and use the
ones that work best for them. He also emphasizes that any lack of
focus isn't your 'fault', or even a 'bad' thing, but that it is
something you may want to have more control over than you currently
do. I found the book effective in giving me strategies to focus on a
task for longer, to be more present in my life, and altogether a very
pleasant read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-coincidence-of-coconut-cake"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25650078-the-coincidence-of-coconut-cake"&gt;The Coincidence of Coconut Cake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/coincidence-of-coconut-cake.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to this audiobook &lt;em&gt;in it's entirety&lt;/em&gt; on a round-trip drive
to Portland, and it was &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; for that trip. It's one of those
candy reads that provides lots of room for imagination, and is sweet
and satisfying. I liked that the characters felt real and believable
(definitely not a given in the romance novel genre), and I loved the
food theme. The heroine was strong and independent, the hero flawed
but loveable. It was more chaste than I was expecting, and more of a
rom-com book than a proper romance novel. A quick and easy read, if
you find yourself between better books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've unknowingly been on a books-by-women-about-women kick
this summer - I didn't even notice until scrolling through my library
history. And honestly I'm really into it. This has been a pretty good
run of high-quality reads, most of them the right balance of fun and
meaningful. I've talked before about &amp;quot;vegetable books&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;candy
books&amp;quot;, but I think many of these reads can probably be called &amp;quot;fruit
books&amp;quot;: sweet, and secretly good for you. And often brightly colored
on the outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I fell in love with both of the heroines in this book. They're
such rich, complex, layered characters I felt like I knew them in real
life. Camille Perri is a master at describing emotional responses,
details in interactions, and wardrobes, in a way that paints such a
complete picture of Katie and Cassidy's relationship. I loved how she
bent gendered stereotypes so effortlessly: of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; Katie was going
to fall for Cassidy, of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; they were meant to be together. A
fantastic modern love story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it possible for there to be a hilarious book about cancer? Well, if
it is, I can't imagine it gets better than &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36373380-the-bucket-list"&gt;The Bucket List&lt;/a&gt;. The
protagonist is a sarcastic young woman who so closely mirrors my own
struggle with balancing work and feminism and life and womanhood it's
like reading my diary. What I love about this book is the voice and
style of the character, the way she's not just contending with having
the BRCA 1 gene mutation but also &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt; as a 20-something in New
York. Highly, highly recommended reading for the right mix of fun and
thought-provoking.&lt;/p&gt;

Before&lt;/a&gt; since Netflix made it &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80203147"&gt;a movie&lt;/a&gt;, but I'm here to throw in
another &amp;quot;You should read this!&amp;quot;.  It's more YA than fiction or
romance, but is so sweet and (for a 23 year old like me) nostalgic.
It's a wonderful teenage romance, with all the angst and drama and
heightened emotions you'd expect but without the jerky boys and
vampires. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.gq.com/story/horny-for-wholesome"&gt;This GQ article&lt;/a&gt; sums it up: &amp;quot;At last, with the help of
Netflix, we have our new type: the wholesome man.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

read MMM, you're probably either 1. A bro who identifies strongly with
him and who loves to brag to your friends about how you haven't eaten at a
restaurant for 3 years or 2. A normal person who was intimidated away
from the notion of saving for retirement. But it doesn't have to be
this way! &lt;a class="reference internal" href="#frugalwoods"&gt;Frugalwoods&lt;/a&gt; is a fantastic FIRE blog written by the
eloquent and sensible Elizabeth Willard Thames, where she prescribes a
more balanced and kind approach to frugality. I love that Elizabeth
acknowledges the privilege inherent in elective frugality, that she
preaches spending based on your &lt;em&gt;values&lt;/em&gt; not on miserly living, and
that she is never judgemental or condescending. I love her blog, and
her book is really just a consolidated and long version of that. I
highly highly highly recommend either, whichever suits your fancy, no
matter where your finances are or what your goals are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span id="frugalwoods"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="mr-money-mustache"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="financial-independence-retire-early-fire"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19501.Eat_Pray_Love"&gt;Eat Pray Love&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reread for the third or fourth time, Elizabeth Gilbert's writing is my
comfort food. Her writing style is so warm and expressive, filled with
delicious metaphors and rich descriptions. It's like seeing the world
with entirely new eyes, and inspires me to look closer at myself and
my environment. I love all her memoirish books - &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6728738-committed"&gt;Committed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24453082-big-magic"&gt;Big
Magic&lt;/a&gt; are equally wonderful and revelatory - and love coming back to
them at different points throughout my life. A book is never the same
when you come back to it, and each time I notice a new passage or
insight that I somehow missed the first 4 times through. Rather than
recommending you read EPL, though, I recommend picking up a favorite
read from a few years ago. What book do you keep coming back to, or
take comfort in reading?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-fall-of-marigolds"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18114142-a-fall-of-marigolds"&gt;A Fall of Marigolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/a-fall-of-marigolds.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be honest, this book didn't resonate with me that much. I found
one of the main characters - who narrates most of the book - to be
wishy-washy and limp. I didn't like her, though perhaps I wasn't
supposed to like her? Regardless the book was at least good enough to
finish, seemed to resonate with many other people, and while I didn't
&lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; the characters it was well-written and clever. If you like
historical fiction, or stories set in New York, this is for you!&lt;/p&gt;

still in the dog days of summer, soaking in the sunshine and trying to
ignore the back-to-school ads even though we're not technically on
summer break anymore. My summer has been busy in the best possible
way, and I feel like I've made the most of every moment. There've been
barbecues, berry-picking, hikes, a wedding, movies, ice cream,
farmers markets, and of course so much time with friends and family.
And books! Here's what I've been enjoying lately:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-curious-charms-of-arthur-pepper"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26722820-the-curious-charms-of-arthur-pepper"&gt;The Curious Charms of Arthur Pepper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phaedra Patrick&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/charms-of-arthur-pepper.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the sweetest book! With great character development and a
charming story, this book surprised me with it's depth of plot and mix
of eccentric and realistic events. It handled real issues of aging,
life after the loss of a loved one, and finding meaning in life, while
also including a scene about a man who only wear electric blue and
owns several tigers. Definitely the feel-good story of the summer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="when-life-gives-you-lululemons"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36373647-when-life-gives-you-lululemons"&gt;When Life Gives You Lululemons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lauren Weisberger&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/life-gives-you-lululemons.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know &lt;em&gt;The Devil Wears Prada&lt;/em&gt; is a series?? Me neither. This is
the third installment, which I didn't even realize until I looked at
the goodreads page after finishing it. You definitely don't need to
have read the 2nd one to understand this one, and if you like DWP you
will love &lt;em&gt;When Life Gives You Lululemons&lt;/em&gt;! It's funny, relatable,
heartbreaking, and in the end victorious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="save-the-date"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="#save-the-date"&gt;Save the Date&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mary Kay Andrews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/save-the-date.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cute enough romance story. I'm honestly not a huge fan of the
love-to-hate trope, but did love that the female lead was a business
owner and in the end grew to like both characters. Not my first
recommendation, but a quick candy read if your romance novel TBR list
has dried up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-handmaid-s-tale"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="#the-handmaid-s-tale"&gt;The Handmaid's Tale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Margaret Atwood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="theme/images/handmaids-tale.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be honest: I really didn't like this book. But I still think you
should read it. Since I can't handle watching the show, reading the
book is the next best way to be able to talk to other people about
the story and to understand the nuances of how it's used in everyday
conversation. This book is definitely part of our modern zeitgeist,
and as painful as oflgen's lack of character development and action
is, and as painful as Atwood's over-the-top grandiose writing style
is, there's a lot to unpack and discuss. Get through it, then be like
me and tell everyone all the things you didn't like about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

have found myself reading one great book after another! Great might
actually be a bit of a strong word for these books -- maybe fun is
more appropriate? Regardless, these books are ~perfect~ for the
upcoming summer months, with it's beach trips, long drives, airplane
rides, and lazy Sundays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-dry"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Dry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jane Harper&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the book all your Liane-Moriarty-fan friends are going to be
talking about this summer. Set in a rural Australian town, a father,
mother, and son are found dead on their farm leaving only their baby
daughter alive. Initially suspected to be a murder-suicide by the
father figure,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="when-rishi-met-dimple"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;cite&gt;When Rishi Met Dimple&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sandhya Menon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a tremendously enjoyable YA novel; candy read to the max. I
loved both protagonists, and appreciated what layered and well-rounded
characters they were. Their 'issues' felt very realistic, and the
events of the book didn't feel as contrived as romance and especially
YA romance can often feel. I also of course loved the technical
setting of the book, and a strong female lead. Highly recommended easy
reading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pachinko"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Pachinko&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Min Jin Lee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read this for a book club, and since there were approximately 1
million holds on the audio book and e-book at the Library, I ended up
picking up the physical hard-cover copy of it. This is the first
physical book I've read at least since college, probably since high
school, and I'll admit I was a little worried I had forgotten how to
read physical books. But not so! I surprised myself by reading this
600 page book in just 5 days, and was &lt;em&gt;riveted&lt;/em&gt;. I didn't expect I
would like the book itself, much less in book-form, but found myself
reading it every chance I got. I loved the focus on characters and not
events, the way that despite triumphs and tragedies life continues to
go on, and the way we see social changes reflected in the characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-royal-we"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Royal We&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heather Cocks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another candy read 🙃  but that's what summer is for, right?? I loved
this royal wedding fan-fic, and while the royal wedding has passed us
by (cries) we can still read about royal wedding drama right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-sisterhood-of-the-travelling-pants"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ann Brashares&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A classic! I re-read this recently (in one day, no less) to celebrate
the arrival of summer, and was surprised by how well it stood the test
of time and aging.  Perhaps part of my love is for the nostalgia of
reading it when I was growing up, but I fell right back in love with
the 4 heroines and their friendship. We don't write about female
friendship enough, and these ladies are truly inspiring! More like
this please thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

because I had a rather unlucky streak of uninspiring books. It wasn't
that these were &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; books, but they just weren't the type of books
that felt worth sharing. &lt;cite&gt;The Commitment&lt;/cite&gt; by Dan Savage is the perfect
example: while I enjoy Savage's writing, this was a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; book where
Savage tries to convince the (presumably liberal) reader that same-sex
marriage should be legal. Either you agree with him and gain nothing
from the book, or you disagree with him and only make it 2 pages in.
I didn't regret reading it, but definitely didn't think it was worth
writing about. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25810091-the-never-open-desert-diner"&gt;The Never-Open Desert Diner&lt;/a&gt; is another good example:
it was perfectly enjoyable but kind of weird and I don't know that I
would say I recommend it? It was pretty far outside of my typical
literary diet, and while it was great to step out of my comfort zone
I'd feel dishonest encouraging others to read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But! Things have turned around. I've read a number of great books over
the course of February and March, and have finally compiled enough to
warrant a post. I'm a few days past the 'Spring Reads' deadline, but
we'll call it Spring Reads anyway ;) Here's what I've been enjoying
lately:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-muse"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27213208-the-muse"&gt;The Muse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jessie Burton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book took me by surprise, and was such a delight! It's a clever
story with wonderfully complex characters, and who create great
tension and conflict with each other. It's so hard to write characters
who are all likeable and empathetic but still create believable
conflict, and Jessie Burton nailed it. A bit of a long one, but worth
every hour!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-grownup"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26025580-the-grownup"&gt;The Grownup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gillian Flynn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A half-step closer to horror than &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19288043-gone-girl"&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/a&gt;, this short story by
Gillian Flynn proves &amp;quot;Gone Girl&amp;quot; was no fluke. It's impossible to tell
what's true, who's lying, and what really happened. Strong female
lead, plot twists I never saw coming, and an open ending make this a
story that you'll keep thinking about long after putting it down.
Highly recommend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="lily-and-the-octopus"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27276262-lily-and-the-octopus"&gt;Lily and the Octopus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stephen Rowley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read this because it was the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://girlybookclub.com/"&gt;Girly Book Club's&lt;/a&gt; March read, and I
have mixed feelings about it. It's an unusual and heart-wrenching
read, but I didn't feel like it brought anything new to the
sad-book-about-a-dying-dog genre of books. The book follows Ted as he
grapples with the inevitable death of his beloved companion, a
dachshund named Lily. It was honestly hard to empathize with Ted, and
while there's no wrong way to grieve it was hard to be in the mind of
someone who is so lonely and who's only friend is a dying dog. At the
same time, it has rich descriptions, great characters, and is
excellent at making Lily a character as much as Ted. So...a mixed bag.
Read at your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="call-me-by-your-name"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/98687.Call_Me_by_Your_Name"&gt;Call Me By Your Name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;André Aciman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my favorite book ever. Period. The best movie, and the best
book. Elio is so expressive and emotional. As I've gotten older I
think I've lost touch with that emotional side of myself, for better
or worse. Especially in America I think it's typical to numb yourself
in order to 'get through' everyday life, and we quickly forget what
it's like to feel much of anything very strongly. &amp;quot;Call Me By Your
Name&amp;quot; reminds me to not be afraid of feeling too much, to be
vulnerable and present and that even the lows have a certain richness
to them when you really &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; them. I love the setting, I love the
story, I love the characters. I want to live in the world and the
character that Aciman has created everyday, and am glad that for at
least a few hours this week I was able to escape to that place. This
is definitely a read that I'll keep coming back to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've been meaning to read more but aren't sure how to get started, or
aren't satisfied with your current reading process, this post is for you!
Some parts of the process I've been doing for years, others are parts that I'm
actively working to do more diligently and improve at. Let's dive in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="finding-books-to-read"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finding Books to Read&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this isn't a very universal or sustainable way of finding books
to read, but I honestly just go to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://powells.com"&gt;Powell's&lt;/a&gt; books in Portland, OR and see
what's on their shelves that looks interesting. They have a wide selection of
new books, sprinkled with classics and a-few-years-ago best-sellers, and
wandering their aisles + checking the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://powells.com/staff-picks"&gt;new and recommended&lt;/a&gt; list provides me
with plenty of reading suggestions! One caveat: this definitely involves
judging books by their covers, and I'm not ashamed of it. I honestly like
reading books that I know nothing about because it avoids coloring my
experience with expectations, and much like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem"&gt;the halting problem&lt;/a&gt; you can't know if
you'll like a book until you've read it anyway. So, a cover seems a fine thing
to judge it by. I also occasionally will have books recommended through blogs I
read, people I talk to, or just general gossip, but for the most part I find
books through Powell's. If you're not in Portland, I highly recommend finding a
local book store and doing the same!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="acquiring-books"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Acquiring Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the rare exception of cookbooks or books I want to take notes in, I get
all of my books from the library through &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://overdrive.com"&gt;Overdrive&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://meet.libbyapp.com"&gt;Libby&lt;/a&gt; is their new
app -- I haven't tried it yet, but have heard great things!). You can get
e-books (for kindle, or that you can read on your phone or laptop) or audio
books, and depending on the book they get new releases pretty quickly (e-books
faster than audio books). In general I'd say about 80% of the books I'm
interested in reading are available, and those that aren't I request from the
library and they tend to get there eventually. The library automatically checks
books out for you when they become available, and you have them for 3 weeks and
can renew them if you aren't finished, just like for the 'regular' books. I
love getting books this way because it's 1. Free, 2. Supports our local
library, and 3. Makes it super easy to listen to and read books. You can even
listen at faster or slower speeds, add bookmarks, and see the history of books
you've read. It's a &lt;em&gt;fantastic&lt;/em&gt; resource, and I can't recommend it highly
enough!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="reading"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a capital-m Millennial, I tend to prefer audiobooks to e-books so that I
can &amp;quot;read&amp;quot; while commuting, doing chores, running errands, and so on. After
discovering Overdrive about 3 years ago, I went from reading maybe 4 books a
year to reading at least one book each week, and it's completely changed my
life. While listening to books is definitely a different and less engaging
experience than reading them, I simply don't have the time to sit down and read
very often, and audiobooks have made the entire world of books available to me
in a way literature never was before. It's also had the side-effect of making
chores, commuting, and other boring activities things I actually look forward
to, as it's a chance to listen to a story and unwind from the day. Like food,
reading is a personal business, and you should do what works for you. But if
not having time to read is what's been holding you back from picking up a book,
I highly encourage you to give audiobooks a try!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="reflecting"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reflecting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the part I'm especially terrible at. I was pretty good about writing
short &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/tag/book-review.html"&gt;book reviews&lt;/a&gt; of the books I read for a while there, but fell off the
wagon and have never managed to get back on since. I know &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://goodreads.com"&gt;Goodreads&lt;/a&gt; is a
great resource for reflecting on books, and even better having discussions
about them, but I've also not been keeping up with that either. For now, my
reflection is mostly internal, but this is something I'm working to change!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's it! This process has worked for me for years, and I hope there's
some helpful hint here that will help you read more and enjoy what you read! If you're not sure which books to start with, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/category/books.html"&gt;here are some of my favorites&lt;/a&gt;. Happy reading!&lt;/p&gt;

finds you well! It's that time of year again: the leaves have, fallen, the
chill has set in, and the holidays are just over the horizon. I always find
myself reading more in the winter, when it's too cold to leave my apartment and
nothing sounds better than a mug of tea and a book. Whether you're travelling
to visit family, or have some cozy mornings in your future, here's what I can
recommend adding to your reading list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS I'm not a professional enough blogger to make commissions or
anything, but I do have a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/2016-book-gifting-guide.html"&gt;book-themed gift guide&lt;/a&gt; for all the readers
in your life. And we're all readers! Check it out if you're not sure
what to get someone. Ok, on with our regularly scheduled program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="too-fat-too-slutty-too-loud"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33257571-too-fat-too-slutty-too-loud"&gt;Too Fat, Too Slutty, Too Loud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Anne Helen Petersen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="static/too-fat-too-slutty-too-loud.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expected this book to be yet another ranty read about how oppressed women
are. While I think those books are important and read a lot of them, it's
draining to read about the systemic problems and rarely be presented with
solutions. &amp;quot;Too Fat, Too Slutty, Too Loud&amp;quot; absolutely blew me away though.
Petersen's writing is precise, intelligent, and clear, and I found myself
having 'Aha!' moments at least once per chapter. A great read for any feminist
(aka everyone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-music-got-free"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23398715-how-music-got-free"&gt;How Music Got Free&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Stephen Witt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="static/how-music-got-free.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another book I expected to be dull, but which turned out to be great! Rather
than laying out the facts in chronological order, &amp;quot;How Music Got Free&amp;quot; wove
together the stories from 3 people who contributed to the rise and fall of
the pirated music industry. It's an epic story, told more like a novel than a
non-fiction account. Thoroughly entertaining and interesting, whether you
like (and pirate) music or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tiny-beautiful-things"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13152194-tiny-beautiful-things"&gt;Tiny Beautiful Things&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Cheryl Strayed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="static/tiny-beautiful-things.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love everything Cheryl Strayed writes. If she wrote a phone book, I'd
probably read it. Her work is consistently thought provoking, concise,
beautiful, and profound, and &amp;quot;Tiny Beautiful Things&amp;quot; is quintessential Cheryl.
A compilation of advice columns, &amp;quot;Tiny Beautiful Things&amp;quot; is all about
understanding the human experience. Part poetry, part therapy, entirely worth
reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="commonwealth"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28214365-commonwealth"&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Ann Patchett&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="static/commonwealth.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book may not be for everyone, but as a reader who loves a good cast of
characters &amp;quot;Commonwealth&amp;quot; was right up my alley. The characters were rich and
realistic, and the plot follows the story of a blended family we know all to
well with an unexpected twist. An excellent low-stress read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="big-little-lies"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19486412-big-little-lies"&gt;Big Little Lies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Liane Moriarty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="static/big-little-lies.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know you already know this one, so let me just throw my recommendation in with all the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="turtles-all-the-way-down"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35504431-turtles-all-the-way-down"&gt;Turtles All the Way Down&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By John Green&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="static/turtles-all-the-way-down.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you're not a young adult, John Green's latest novel is a wonderful
and quick read. It's narrated by the protagonist, Aza Holmes, a young woman
trying to live with and manage obsessive-compulsive disorder while trying to
be a good daughter, good friend, and a good detective. What I loved about it
was that it helped me understand at least one person's experience of mental
illness, and helped humanize and sympathize disordered thinking for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="static/kitchens-of-the-great-midwest4.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kitchens of the Great Midwest is just about the sweetest book.
Following the life of Eva Thorvald through the eyes of those around her,
this book details the joys and pains of growing up in the midwest. Filled
with food and a kindness only midwesterners can muster, KotGM is the
perfect compliment to sunshine and lazy days in the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-everything-became-war-and-the-military-became-everything"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29238798-how-everything-became-war-and-the-military-became-everything"&gt;How Everything Became War, and the Military Became Everything&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Rosa Brooks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="static/how-everything-became-war.jpg" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite it's tongue-twisting title, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29238798-how-everything-became-war-and-the-military-became-everything"&gt;How Everything Became War, and
the Military Became Everything&lt;/a&gt; might be the best book I read all
year. The military has never been part of my family or culture, yet as
an American has tremendous impact on my life. A former Pentagon
reporter, Rosa Brooks brings incredible insight into the current state
of the military, and how it got to where it is. What influence does it
yield? Why? What are the consequences of that? I learned &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt;
reading this book, and like all the best books it gave me new
perspective and understanding of the world we live in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-magnolia-story"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28668633-the-magnolia-story"&gt;The Magnolia Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Chip and Joanna Gaines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I know I know I know I know. Judge all you want, I am
head-over-heels for Chip and Joanna Gaines, and their book did not
disappoint. They're so funny! And cute!  Perfect for beach reading and
flower gazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-bell-jar"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28668633-the-magnolia-story"&gt;The Bell Jar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Sylvia Plath&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bell Jar flat out surprised me. I think of it as Classic Literature,
and often find that Classic Literature is too masculine or too opaque for
my casual reading tastes. This book was anything but! Plath's
semi-autobiographical novel is the beautiful story of a young woman trying
to find her&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="beautiful-ruins"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11447921-beautiful-ruins"&gt;Beautiful Ruins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Jess Walter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to conceive of a book that successfully explores so many characters,
time periods, locations, and relationships in a cohesive story. But Walter is
able to take us from the Italian coast in the 1960's to modern day Hollywood to
the middle of nowhere Idaho without muddling the story or confusing the reader.
Rich characters, interesting plot, and Hollywood glamour make this a delightful
read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Semi-autobiographical, the language Plath uses to describe her/Esther's
outlook, experiences, and later treatments is &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt;. Her writing
puts the reader right into Esther's head, and gives them an
understanding of what living with a mental illness is like. Even
better, her language changes throughout the novel as Esther's health
changes, reflecting her darker moods, as well as her better days.
Esther is a fantastically sympathetic and vibrant character, despite
her cynicism and depression. I found myself really invested in her
story and experiences, and again Plath's writing paints a luscious
picture of that story. I don't want to oversell this novel -- I think
part of why I loved it is because I came into it expecting it to be
Yet Another Classic Book which I often find to be overly masculine.
But this wasn't. Throughout the book, even at the peak of Esther's
descent into mental illness, I found myself identifying really
strongly with her and investing in what happened to her. It feels rare
to read a book in a woman's voice that's highly regarded, and I was
very pleasantly surprised by the femininity that colors the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this was another great read. Again, expectations definitely
may have played into my reading, but on the whole I was blown away by
the style, substance, characters, and story of The Bell Jar. Highly,
highly recommended summer reading!&lt;/p&gt;

be the best book I read this year. The military has never been a part
of the cultures I grew up in, so my knowledge and awareness of
what the military is, how it's run, and what it does is basically
nothing. I couldn't even tell you all of the branches, or the
distinctions between them. With this context in mind, this book held
incredible insight for me. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rosabrooks.com/"&gt;Rosa Brooks&lt;/a&gt;, a former reporter for the
Pentagon, explains not only what the military does but why it does it,
how it does it, what impacts those actions have. She's able to support
her claims with ample evidence as well as personal stories, and
defends her statements and positions from every possible angle. She
also looks at various parts of the military under a microscope,
explaining the history of this unit or that organization and where
they are today, and also looks very broadly at the military as a whole
complex system and how that system is working. She asks questions like
&amp;quot;What does it mean to be a solider, both historically and today? How
has that role changed in the last 2000 years and in the last decade?&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;Why is our military a proxy for diplomacy, nation building, and
relief effort?&amp;quot;. She explores the relationship between soldiers and
civilians, and how that too has changed dramatically over time.
I came away from the book with a greater
understanding of our military's history, it's present state, and how
it came to be the way that it is. I know more about what the military
does and why it does it, and the pros and cons of having the military
partake in all of the actions that it does.&lt;/p&gt;

daughters married to a man of means. What I loved about Eligible was
that the author stayed very true to the characters while modernizing
them seamlessly. Jane is sensible and pragmatic, Mrs.Bennet is
exasperated and a little manipulative, Lydia and Kitty are thick as
thieves and a little wild, and Mary is awkward and unaware. Avid P&amp;amp;P
fans (ahem, Mackenzie Broderick) may hold a more critical eye to the
novel, but a pleb like me who has only read P&amp;amp;P twice will no doubt
enjoy the classic tale of women, ambitions, and marriage, told in a
modern setting.&lt;/p&gt;

January is such a melancholy month, isn't it? The

January is such a melancholy month, isn't it? The
festivities and gatherings have ended, everyone is back to work and
school, and there are weeks of dark, cold days¹ ahead of us. So, to get
my mind off my SO's departure I listened to Jessi Klein's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27170141-you-ll-grow-out-of-it"&gt;You'll Grow
Out of It&lt;/a&gt;. I had seen this book splashed across the Powell's 'New +
Recommended' lists, in the hands and Instagram accounts of
celebrities, and even had it on personal recommendation from a friend.
And it could not have come at a better time. Jessi's book is all about
coming of age, but instead of focusing on adolescence she focuses on
her twenties and thirties. From terrible boyfriends, to better
boyfriends, to a fiancee, and finally to her pregnancy and child
rearing, Klein's book was a laugh and a comfort when I needed it most.
As comfortable as my situation is now, thinking about the future
&lt;em&gt;terrifies&lt;/em&gt; me. How am I going to have kids &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a career? Do I even
want kids? Do I even want a career? Do I want &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; career? What if
things don't work out with my current SO? What if I can't get
pregnant? Or worse, what if I &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; get pregnant? Oh god oh god oh
god oh god oh god oh god. I know I'm not alone, that my millennial
peers are worrying the same worries and fearing the same futures. But
it's still so profoundly comforting to hear the journey of someone you
admire. That the best laid plans often go astray, and that &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;
planning can work itself out. That &lt;strong&gt;you will be OK&lt;/strong&gt; because Jessi
was OK and she doesn't have this any more figured out than you do.
I highly highly highly recommend this book. It will be a friend to
you, no matter where you are or where you see your life going. It will
get you through those dark January days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 The bright side (ha) is that, because I get into the office before
sunrise and leave after sunset, I don't need to wear sunscreen. Score.&lt;/p&gt;

to the book on tape where flipping to page 129 wasn't exactly feasible
:p . The author himself narrates it though, and did his best to take
us through the book from start to finish without getting lost along
the way. NPH's past, from aspiring adolescent actor to young stardom
to proud husband and parent, is an interesting story told with classic
NPH humor. I can't say it was my favorite autobiography, as it
definitely erred on the side of trying too hard to be funny rather
than genuine or meaningful. But, walking the streets of San Francisco,
this book definitely held my interested and brightened my days. It was
entertaining, but didn't leave me feeling like I had insight into who
NPH was as a person at all. I will say, though, that listening to him
talk (or read aloud) about his kids was &lt;em&gt;heart melting&lt;/em&gt;.  I had no
idea what the experiences of being a &amp;quot;closeted&amp;quot; gay celebrity or a gay couple trying to
have kids were, and hearing about those first-hand was super
interesting. Definitely a tiny drop of knowledge from a world I know
little or nothing about, which is always excellent!  Overall, I
definitely recommend this book if you're looking for something light,
that doesn't require too much attention, or love all things NPH.&lt;/p&gt;

Be Different&lt;/a&gt; by Maria Semple. And unfortunately, it won't be finding
it's way to my 'New + Recommended' list any time soon. The book
follows Eleanor through a particularly whirl-wind day, from her son
Timby feigning illness to her husband becoming an unexpected
Christian. It was charming and short, definitely a decent mindless
read to have on as background noise. Though the main character,
Eleanor, was entertaining I didn't find that I connected with her very
much, or particularly cared what happened to her. That's more on me
than the novel -- she's a nuanced and well-formed character, a mildly
neurotic housewife doing her best amid the mess that is Life, who I
think a lot of people &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; resonate with.  I just didn't. But beyond
that, the book was honestly boring. Boring books aren't always bad,
they can keep you company and fill the space between more grandiose
cousins. But at the end of the day there's nothing memorable, lasting,
or insightful about the book. If you're looking for something to pick
up this isn't the first thing I'd recommend, but it's not the worst
choice either.  It's the 'meh' choice.&lt;/p&gt;

abusive relationships aren't usually as black-and-white as we like to
think. 'It Ends With Us' follows Lily Bloom as she opens her own
flower shop and falls in love with a surgeon, Ryle Kincaid. With a
history of abuse in the family and vivid memories of her mother
covered in bruises and cuts, Lily knows too well the cycle of violence
and apology that so many abusive men exhibit. But when her
relationship with Ryle takes increasingly dark turns, she denies that
anything is wrong. At first they seem like such small incidents --
things that could happen to anybody. We all lose our tempers, or lash
out when we don't mean to. But as Ryle becomes her husband, and then
the father of her child, his violence escalates. With her own daughter
on the way, she's faced with a choice: be just like her mother, or
leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'It Ends With Us' was deeply personal for Colleen Hoover, and that shines
through in the novel. The characters are rich and sympathetic, and
they show the nuance and shades of grey in an abusive relationship.
It's easy to look in from the outside and judge victims of abuse for
staying. How can they not see what's happening to them? How can they
live each day with people who hit them, or scream at them? 'It Ends
With Us' helped me understand how those relationships are like frogs
in hot water, how abusive husbands can have a lot of good qualities
and think they are good people (though make no mistake, they are
&lt;em&gt;monsters&lt;/em&gt;), and how it can be easy to explain away incidents of
abuse. I won't spoil anything, but I will say that there's also a very
happy ending, which was well worth sticking around for!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was deeply touched by 'It Ends With Us', and came away not only with
another good love story in my ears but with a deeper understanding of
what victims of abuse go through. The mark of a great book is one that
not only entertains and rivets, but that changes the way you move
through everyday life and see the world.&lt;/p&gt;

this every year: it's always too early to start thinking about the
holidays until December 20th, and then I'm scrambling to find or make
good gifts for my family and friends. I don't know about you, but I do
&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; work best under that kind of pressure. I also don't have the
foresight to do what my mom does and just shop for presents
year-round, finding things she thinks people will like. We can't all
be planners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, November 4th seems like a good enough in between. And what better
gift is there to give than a good story?  Whether your
recipient is an enthusiastic reader or hasn't picked up a book in
years, I think there's something for everyone at the local book store.
Here are my recommendations, no matter who you're giving to!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="for-the-non-reader"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For the Non-Reader&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is definitely the hardest person to buy a book for. But with
the rise of audiobooks, coloring books, and graphic novels
I think you can find something for everyone! Let's break it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="audiobooks"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Audiobooks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't overstate how much I love audiobooks. I spend so much time
walking, running, doing laundry, cooking, stretching, &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt;, and
being able to spend that time with a book in my ears has been
life changing. I use &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://app.overdrive.com/"&gt;Overdrive&lt;/a&gt; (way better than Audible!), which
connects to your local library and lets you download e-books and
audiobooks to any device, including &lt;em&gt;your phone&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;For free&lt;/strong&gt;.
Fancy, right? Here's how you can turn that into a non-reader gift:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set it up&lt;/strong&gt;. Installing the app, connecting it to the library,
downloading books, connecting the phone to the
car...it can be a lot. Getting everything ready to go so your loved
one just has to press 'play' could be the push they need to remember
how much they love books!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CDs&lt;/strong&gt;. I know I know I know. But again, sometimes setting it all
up on the phone is just too much.  Give your loved one a book on
tape they can play in the car. Especially perfect if you've got an
upcoming road trip!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your own recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;. Sharing a book together is a beautiful
thing. Seeing a novel through someone else's eyes can open up new
perspectives, interpretations, and meaning you may not have seen.
And you get to share a thing you love with a person you love.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="coloring-books"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Coloring Books&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've seen them.  You've thought &amp;quot;Really? Adult coloring books?&amp;quot;.
Your friend's mom has one. And now, your mom can have one too!
Coloring is meditative, methodic, excellent to keep your hands busy
while watching TV.  Here are a few that look neat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.powells.com/book/secret-garden-an-inky-treasure-hunt-coloring-book-9781780671062/1-20"&gt;The Secret Garden&lt;/a&gt;. Kind of the OG coloring book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.powells.com/book/color-me-calm-100-coloring-templates-for-meditation-relaxation-9781937994778/1-0"&gt;Color Me Calm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="graphic-novels"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Graphic Novels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just for kids! Graphic novels have grown into beautifully
illustrated, intricate stories with as much character development,
plot, and meaning as any other book.  Here are a few that are really
stunning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25179.Blankets"&gt;Blankets&lt;/a&gt; by Craig Thompson. This was definitely the first graphic
novel I read where I realized what a graphic novel could be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22040598-the-sculptor"&gt;The Sculptor&lt;/a&gt; by Scott McCloud. Per the recommendation of my SO, a
graphic novel fan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="for-the-history-buff"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For the History Buff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27209433-white-trash"&gt;White Trash: The 400-Year Untold History of Class in America&lt;/a&gt; by
Nancy Isenberg. America is hardly classless,
anybody-can-be-anything country  we like to think it is. This book
recounts the history of the mistreatment of the poor, and discusses
the surprising origins of elitism in the US (hint: owning land used
to be a BFD).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077874-hrc"&gt;HRC&lt;/a&gt; by Amie Parnes and Jonathan Allen. You may as well start
reading up on the life and times of our future president ;) It
focuses on her time as Secretary of State, but I think it has great
insight into how she makes decisions, what motivates her, and is
relatively objective and accurate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="for-the-girl-boss"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For the Girl Boss&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far the hardest category to narrow down, it's hard to go wrong with
any of these titles for the feminist reader (woops, sorry, I
misspelled 'everyone') in your life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33257571-too-fat-too-slutty-too-loud"&gt;Too Fat, Too Slutty, Too Loud&lt;/a&gt; by Anne Helen Petersen. I expected
this to be a ranty read about how women are oppressed, and instead
got some of the best essays I've ever read. This book describes how
women are scrutinized and judged by examining 9 famous women who are
too-something: too strong, too pregnant, too old, too shrill. A
great read!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29340182-shrill"&gt;Shrill&lt;/a&gt; by Lindy West. So many 'aha' moments in this book.
Lindy West names and confronts some uncomfortable truths in this
book.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll become a better human.
Really you should just get it for yourself as a present.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29405093-the-girl-with-the-lower-back-tattoo"&gt;The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo&lt;/a&gt; by Amy Schumer. An incredibly
intimate look into who Amy Schumer is, and how she came to be the
person she is today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12262741-wild"&gt;Wild&lt;/a&gt; by Cheryl Strayed. I know this book was trendier last year,
but if your loved one didn't get a chance to read it it's well worth
coming back to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17851885-i-am-malala"&gt;I am Malala&lt;/a&gt; by Malala Yousafzai. If you're not sure who she is,
you &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; need to read this.  If you know her, you know why
you need to read this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20910157-yes-please"&gt;Yes, Please&lt;/a&gt; by Amy Pohler. The life and times of an amazing
woman, featuring some great advice we could all use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="for-the-mathlete"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For the Mathlete&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are ordered by difficulty + level of math, from most advanced to
most accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24113.G_del_Escher_Bach"&gt;Gödel, Escher, Bach&lt;/a&gt; by Douglas Hofstadter is a mind-bending, brain-exploding math +
philosophy book. This is perfect your friend who just started grad
school.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17290683-love-and-math"&gt;Love and Math&lt;/a&gt; by Edward Frenkel is just a great math book.  Part memoir, part
linear algebra, Edward Frenkel discusses how he came to love math,
what he endured to be part of the mathematics community, and what he
spent his life researching and discovering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693884-how-not-to-be-wrong"&gt;How Not to Be Wrong&lt;/a&gt; by Jordan Ellenberg is for the armchair mathematician. It's a
critical analysis of how we approach problems, and common data
analytics methods.  More &amp;quot;How to think about this real-world issue&amp;quot; than
&amp;quot;Here's how Andrew Wiles solved the Fermat Theorem&amp;quot;.  My favorite
quote is:
&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;And you can't deny that there are aspects of the natural
world - I'm thinking pandas here - that seem more likely to have
resulted from grudging bureaucratic compromise than from the mind of
an all knowing deity with total creative control&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="for-the-csi-fan"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For the CSI Fan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've unexpectedly started reading mysteries recently. I
didn't even know what I was getting myself into, but here are a few
juicy ones I've enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Big Little Lies&lt;/cite&gt; by Liane Moriarty. I'm sure that every
self-respecting mystery reader has already read through Liane
Moriarty's entire catalog. BUT IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO HASN'T, do
them a favor and get them this book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27274343-i-m-thinking-of-ending-things"&gt;I'm Thinking of Ending Things&lt;/a&gt; by Iain Reid. A short but
satisfying thriller.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26114146-all-is-not-forgotten"&gt;All is Not Forgotten&lt;/a&gt; by Wendy Walker. As a mystery noob, I'm &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt;
invested in this book. Is it the son?  The pot dealer? I was hooked,
and so satisfied by the ending.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22557272-the-girl-on-the-train"&gt;The Girl on the Train&lt;/a&gt; by Paula Hawkins. Honestly, when I first read it I
thought it was a little meh. I had a hard time connecting to the
main character, or caring about what happened to her. But with all
the hype + the movie, I may have to give it another read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="for-the-friend-with-a-bb8-pillow"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For the Friend with a BB8 Pillow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AKA Sci-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/375802.Ender_s_Game"&gt;Ender's Game&lt;/a&gt; by Orson Scott Card is a classic sci-fi read that
lives up to it's legendary status.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9969571-ready-player-one"&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/a&gt; by Ernest Cline is a totally accessible and fun
story. It's a classic hero's tale, with 80's geek and gamer culture
mixed in. Highly recommend for readers of any age.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12007.Use_of_Weapons"&gt;Use of Weapons&lt;/a&gt; by Iain Banks is by far my favorite sci-fi book.
Great characters, an excellent ending, compelling plot, and very
interesting premise. Highly, highly recommend for all readers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59924.The_Lathe_of_Heaven"&gt;The Lathe of Heaven&lt;/a&gt; by Ursula K. LeGuin is a solid, satisfying
sci-fi adventure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

was a surprising delight to read. Like most books I checked it out
only knowing that Powell's had it on their 'New + Recommended' list,
and was pleased when I found myself in the middle of a psychological
thriller, begging the protagonist not to go into the basement. The
novel starts out innocuously, and it wasn't until maybe 2/3 of the way
through that I realized it wasn't going the direction I expected &lt;em&gt;at
all&lt;/em&gt;.  I don't want to give too much away, but this a quick and
satisfying read if you're up for a little horror and a little thrill.
The ending is entirely unexpected, and raises a lot of interesting
points about our identity, perceptions, reality, and the pliability of
the human mind.  I would highly highly recommend it!&lt;/p&gt;

season, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26893819-the-girls"&gt;The Girls&lt;/a&gt; by Emma Cline.  I was very intrigued by this book
since it had been hyped so much, and after reading it am somewhat
mystified by the noise around it.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't a
&lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; book.  But if I had the ear of millions of people, it's
definitely not the first one I would recommend either. I'll start with
what I liked, compliment sandwich style.  Emma Cline's use of language
is incredible, and her ability to set a scene and make you &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt;
every detail of that scene is unparalleled.  Those tiny things you
notice but would never think to write down, or describe in the way she
does, and then the way she builds entire characters and events out of
those details is amazing. You can feel sticky heat, the stings of
shame, the meaning imbued in a moment's hesitation or a sideways
glance.  All of those microscopic tinges are blown up to full size,
and make the book &lt;em&gt;rich&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so, I loved Cline's writing, why was the book just meh? The
content was really the downfall of this book.  I didn't find any of
the characters compelling, and found it &lt;em&gt;painfully&lt;/em&gt; slow at many
points. There's a murder set up in the opening paragraphs which
becomes the climax of the story, but the journey to that climax takes
&lt;em&gt;so long&lt;/em&gt; and involves little to no detail about the murder.  Someone
dies, and we don't even know or care about that person. The murder is
supposed to be the climax, but at the end falls utterly flat.  I will
give Cline credit for her time-jumping between modern day and memory.
She used it well to develop the main character and made it obvious which
era you were currently reading, both of which are hard to do well and
hard to do well at the same time. But in the end that definitely
couldn't save a half-hearted story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're thinking about picking it up, and leave it at the bottom of
your to-read list. It's definitely worth giving a try, but I wouldn't
hurry to read it.&lt;/p&gt;

read &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.garthstein.com/works/the-art-of-racing-in-the-rain/"&gt;The Art of Racing in the Rain&lt;/a&gt; by Garth Stein. As a dog owner
and lover I was simultaneously excited and wary of another book about
a dog where the dog inevitably the dog dies at the end. But I set
aside my trepidation and dove in, and was rewarded tremendously for
doing so! The book is narrated by a dog, Enzo, as he chronicles the
life of his beloved owner Denny. But it is about &lt;em&gt;so much more&lt;/em&gt; than
the relationship between a man and his dog.  It's about the pain of
cancer and death, the different ways we grieve, and ultimately focuses
on how bad things happen to good people. It's about making the hardest
right decisions, about being the bigger person, all told through the
lens of racing (yes, car racing) by the canine narrator.  And it made
me &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; so strongly.  I had such visceral reactions to the events of
the book, and realized that was part of what made it so good.  The
characters were so compelling, the events so relatable, I found my
blood boiling at points, experienced jubilation and depression and
grief right alongside the characters.  So much malice! So much hope!
The role of the dog as narrator doesn't even really stand out in
hindsight, as it's completely eclipsed by the richness of the rest of
the novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if you couldn't tell, I loved the book and would highly
recommend it. I'll admit it starts out a little slow, but try to power
through at least 1/3 of it before giving up entirely (it's a short
read). It made my rainy Sunday fly by, and is appropriately the perfect
rainy-weekend companion :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29405093-the-girl-with-the-lower-back-tattoo"&gt;The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo&lt;/a&gt; by Amy
Schumer. Not just
another comedian's memoir, Amy's book offers fascinating insight into
how she became the person (and celebrity) she is today.  With
heartbreaking stories and a sprinkling of levity, this might be my
favorite read of the year to date.  You can read more of my thoughts
on the book &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/tgwtlbt.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/american-housewife.jpg" style="height: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25472765-american-housewife"&gt;American Housewife&lt;/a&gt; by Helen Ellis.  This is a quirky yet
relatable collection of short stories about what it means to be a
modern woman.  My favorite story was hands down The Fitter, but each
is a gem unto itself.  Want to know what it's about? You know how to
find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/hunger-makes-me.jpg" style="height: 400px;" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25065629-hunger-makes-me-a-modern-girl"&gt;Hunger Makes Me a Modern Girl&lt;/a&gt; by Carrie Brownstein. True to form
I love me a good memoir, and Carrie's was the perfect scratch
for my itch. Like Amy Schumer's memoir, HMMaMG is raw and
unapologetic, describing some of the hardest parts of her life and
how she came to be the person she is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/when-breath.jpg" style="height: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25899336-when-breath-becomes-air"&gt;When Breath Becomes Air&lt;/a&gt; by Paul Kalanithi. I didn't know much
about this book going in, but was stunned by the eloquence and voice
of Paul's writing. His story is interesting and deeply sad, and I
found myself crying on the way to class at the end. Definitely a
short but worthwhile read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/the-assistants.jpg" style="height: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26067909-the-assistants"&gt;The Assistants&lt;/a&gt; by Camille Perri. Part office gossip, part juicy
crime novel, I couldn't read this book fast enough.  I loved Camille's
characters, the genius (and not contrived) story, the setting and
conflicts and intimacies of people we work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/theme/images/shrill.jpg" style="height: 400px;" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29340182-shrill"&gt;Shrill&lt;/a&gt; by Lindy West. A reminder that we are all human beings, and
that we need to treat each other accordingly. But told really, really
well. Seriously, just read it, and become the better person you know
you can be.&lt;/p&gt;

as 'Feminist', whatever that means, but didn't know much else going
in.  Unlike many books I finish, my feelings about it are complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is a chronicle of terrible experiences she has had around
gender, from getting cat-called, to being in abusive relationships,
to getting death threats on the internet.  While I identified with a
number of her experiences and appreciated that her book made me
think more about how I'm treated, I finished it feeling sad and very
much tired of talking about gender.  There's no call to action or
even real cause-effect to her stories. It's just the stories as they
happened, told like the script for a movie: all facts, with little
&amp;quot;Here's how this &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have happened&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Here's what you, as a
man, woman, or child, can do&amp;quot; or even &amp;quot;Here's how I wish I had
reacted&amp;quot;.  I find so often that when &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.lucywyman.me/boy.html"&gt;men don't treat me with
respect&lt;/a&gt; I have no idea how to react in the moment, and wish that
she had provided some guidance or thoughts there.  In the end, she
was only telling me things I already knew with no revelatory
thoughts.  Her book didn't change how I see her, how I see the
world, how I react to various situations, or how I understand gender
or being a woman.  Perhaps she was targeting those who don't even
realize what misogyny looks like, or how common aggression is, but
honestly those people are not the same people who are going to be
reading her book. The people who are going to read her book are
people like me, who know and recognize that they are frequently
treated like sex objects.  In the end, I feel sorry for how
extremely unpleasant many of her experiences are, and that there's
little or nothing she and I can do about it, but I didn't need to
read this book to understand that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for other great reads by great women, I'd
recommend picking up Amy Schumer's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29405093-the-girl-with-the-lower-back-tattoo"&gt;The Girl with the Lower Back
Tattoo&lt;/a&gt;, Jenny Lawson's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23848559-furiously-happy"&gt;Furiously Happy&lt;/a&gt;, Mindy Kaling's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10335308-is-everyone-hanging-out-without-me"&gt;Is
Everyone Hanging Out Without Me&lt;/a&gt;, or Lindy West's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29340182-shrill"&gt;Shrill&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit (10/11/2016):&lt;/strong&gt; I've meditated on the purpose of 'Sex Object'
since writing this, and I think there are a few possible and very
worthwhile reasons she wrote it. First and foremost is to process,
understand, and ultimately come to terms with her experiences.  I hope
she found some modicum (however small) of peace or catharsis in
writing the book.  Second, though, I think it is to tell other women
they are not alone. That sexism and degradation are systemic,
pervasive, and that it is not &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;their fault&lt;/em&gt;.  I know for
many women, including my own mother, the issue of blame and cause is
placed on them instead of the actual actors and perpetrators.  I also want to
acknowledge that to some extent my critique is unrealistic: there
&lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; a solution, an action I should have taken or can take in the
future, to make this better.  There is no call to action because the
best any of us can do is exactly what she did: talk about it, openly
and frankly, and about why it's wrong.  In the end, I think the book
left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth, but I don't think that's
Jessica Valenti's fault, or any reason to not read her book. If
anything, it's a reason you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; read her book.&lt;/p&gt;

books.  This is in part because so much of my attention was directed at my
new job, in part because nothing I was really excited to read came in, in
part because I was spending a lot of time with my boyfriend before he went
back to school.  But I was ready to break my reading-lull when Amy Schumer's
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29405093-the-girl-with-the-lower-back-tattoo"&gt;The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo&lt;/a&gt; showed up in my reading queue.  Amy
Schumer's not someone I pin all of my feminist hopes and dreams (and labels)
to, but I do appreciate her work and many of the ideas she promotes. Needless
to say I was very excited to read her book (the latest in a long list of
biographies I have read and loved!), and it did not disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TGwtLBT is just as much about the hard, scary, sad parts of Amy's life as it
is about the funny, awkward, we've-all-had-this-happen experiences she's had.
Ultimately it's about the experiences that shaped the person and celebrity
she is today, told honestly and sprinkled with humor.  What made the book
stand out was that she wasn't &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to be funny. Often comedian's books
become comedy sets, told in book form. This is fine to an extent, but offers
no insight into who that person is, or what unique experiences they've had.
Instead of trying to make you laugh Amy tells her story as it is, throwing in
jokes and levity where appropriate without sacrificing the integrity of the
book.  More than a fun pick-me-up read, Amy's book helped me understand how
to interact with the mentally ill, how to handle sexist comments, how to be a
person in the world just a tiny bit better.  If you haven't got your hands on
a copy yet, I can't recommend it enough!&lt;/p&gt;

worried.  Don't let the ads fool you though: this was a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; novel.
I laughed. I cried. I finished it in two days.  The book follows
Louisa Clark, a recently unemployed barista who needs a job to help
her family make ends meet. She takes a job as a sort of low-level
care-giver for a quadriplegic man named Will Traynor, and soon finds
out that he plans to carry out assisted suicide in a few months.  She
takes that time to try to convince him that life, even in a wheelchair
with limited mobility, is worth living, a task which ends up taking
the couple on some (mis)adventures.  It's...kind of a love story?
There's definitely romance. But also &lt;em&gt;so much more&lt;/em&gt;.  As an
able-bodied person, we so rarely think about accessibility, and
increasing the comfort and quality of life for those with
disabilities.  I had never thought about how hard navigating the mall
would be in a wheel chair, how it would feel to not be able to
exercise, and how out of control every aspect of life would be. This
read definitely changed my view of disability, and gave me a lot of
appreciation and gratitude for my body.  It sounds heavy now, but this

you know you'll be tripping to Powell's to pick up some summer reads.
I wanted to make this a regular reading list with a variety of ficiton
and nonfiction books, and I realized that 90% of my choices were
biographies or memoirs.  If you're not into them, don't despair! There are
a few juicy fictional reads at the top of the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_potter_series"&gt;The Harry Potter Series&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on your appetite this series
can take a while, but I recently re-read the whole series and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/harry-potter-series.html"&gt;loved it&lt;/a&gt;.  Definitely worth revisiting if you haven't in a
while, or if you've never read them to begin with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Help"&gt;The Help&lt;/a&gt;. If you haven't already, you should.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/me-before-you"&gt;Me Before You&lt;/a&gt;. I know, I know, it's on every list. I was
skeptical too. But trust me, this book is &lt;em&gt;candy&lt;/em&gt;. Excellent for
any reader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_Weapons"&gt;Use of Weapons&lt;/a&gt;. Even if you aren't familiar with the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_series"&gt;Culture series&lt;/a&gt;,
and don't want to read all 9 books, Use of Weapons is a fantastic stand alone
novel.  The chapters alternate between going forwards in time and backwards,
the characters are impossibly rich and well written, and the twist at the
end will leave you speechless and teary-eyed. Even if you're not a sci-fi
buff, definitely worth reading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/books/committed-a-love-story/"&gt;Committed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/"&gt;Big Magic&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/books/eat-pray-love/"&gt;Eat, Pray, Love&lt;/a&gt;.
You've definitely heard of the last one, but
the first is &lt;em&gt;so much better&lt;/em&gt;. Elizabeth Gilbert is 100% my favorite author,
my guilty pleasure, my comfort food, and her voice is miraculous. I like her
non-fiction better than her fiction (just personally, no literary criticism
here), but anything she writes will definitely lift your day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://thebloggess.com/furiously-happy/"&gt;Furiously Happy&lt;/a&gt;. I'm not sure if this qualifies as a biography, but it
seems close enough. I've read &lt;em&gt;several&lt;/em&gt; comedic ladies biographies (
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/books/bossypants-by-tina-fey-review.html"&gt;Bossypants&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://amysaysyesplease.com/"&gt;Yes Please&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11230081-seriously-i-m-kidding"&gt;Seriously, I'm Kidding&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.avclub.com/review/mindy-kalingem-is-everyone-hanging-out-without-me--64875"&gt;Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) and though hilarious and
inspiring I find the story often gets lost in the authors trying to be
funny. Granted being funny in writing (even in an audiobook) is like marathon
level hard. But &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://thebloggess.com/"&gt;Jenny Lawson&lt;/a&gt; definitely pulls it off in her reading of
her second book &amp;quot;Furiously Happy&amp;quot;, and includes a lot of personal moments
that help plebs like me understand mental illness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://piperkerman.com/orange/about-the-book/"&gt;Orange is the New Black&lt;/a&gt;. I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; the show, but it definitely takes
a lot of artistic license. Piper's actual experience, though less exciting,
is fascinating and well-told.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anything by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sedaris#Bibliography"&gt;David Sedaris&lt;/a&gt;. I especially love &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holidays_on_Ice"&gt;Holidays on Ice&lt;/a&gt;, if you're
a Sedaris newbie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Audacity_of_Hope"&gt;The Audacity of Hope&lt;/a&gt;. Perfect for a quick weekend read, Obama's cool
personal story and charismatic voice make this feel good, palate-cleanser
sort of book. Remind yourself there's good in the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

though unlike &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/brooklyn.html"&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt; I was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't inspiring or
great or anything, nor does it claim to be. It's a very real portrait of
high school, and of someone you know of (but don't really &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt;) dying.
As with any media set in high school your mileage may vary -- no one
has the same experience, and there were definitely a lot of inconsistencies
with my experience of high school. But no matter what your experience was,
it takes you back to the time before adulthood, and the first time you
experienced that confusion and sadness of loss. The main character, Greg,
is a self-depricating, uninspired human in the thick of the teenage years.
He's incredibly well-written, and allows you to forget that he's totally
fiction. It was a great break from
a few more heady books I'm in the middle of, and is a great weekend read
if you're looking for something more seroius than a romance novel but less
serious than LOTR.&lt;/p&gt;

it was made into a movie, and had something to do with a
young woman, the early 20th century, and probably
Brooklyn, NY.  Honestly, even that was too much:
I spent much of my time reading it trying to figure out
why someone would choose to turn &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; book into a film
and came away disappointed.  It was blasé, and while I
don't want to diminish the experience of immigrants
to NY in the early 1900s there was nothing unique,
clever, eye-opening, or otherwise remarkable about the novel.
I liked the main character well enough, but found that
in the end I didn't care what happened to her or any of
the other characters. The main character Eilis and her
sister Rose feel very much like female characters written by
a man. You can very clearly see the lens through which
he views them, the brush strokes he uses to create them,
and that makes them seem very unreal.  They feel more
like what you would get if you asked your well-meaning
grandfather to describe his first love interest than
real women, and without the connection to the characters
I found myself struggling to hold on to anything in the
novel.  I appreciate that Tóibín wrote a novel that centered
on strong female characters, and that such a novel
could be turned into an award-winning film. But before
we congratulate ourselves on appreciating a novel about
a woman who travels alone to America, goes to college
and works, and chats with her sister and female roommates,
let's consider that Eilis probably experienced a lot of
fear, racism, sexism, uncertainty, and hardship that
is generally glossed over. Overall I was underwhelmed,
and wouldn't recommend it if you've got other books
on your list to read.&lt;/p&gt;

describing how math is used (and misused) in everyday
life. From the lottery, to elections, to predicting
the weather and the existence of God, Ellenburg
explains how to develop a better intuition for all the number
and percentages swirling around the news and media. It
focuses mostly on statistics, but also delves into
geometry + algebra (and their relationship), multi-dimensional
spaces and linear algebra, and number theory. As a
&amp;quot;relatively mathy&amp;quot; person, I definitely felt like I got a
lot out of it,though I'm not entirely sure I would recommend
it to less mathematically-inclined readers. Although I believe
it was intended for that audience, and is definitely an
accessible view into high mathematics, it's also a book
about math. My point being: don't expect to be spoon fed
math and magically become knowledgable. Like with all knowledge,
you've gotta put in a little work. But it's &lt;em&gt;totally worth it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Some favorite quotes:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;And you can't deny that there are aspects of the natural world - I'm
thinking pandas here - that seem more likely to have resulted from grudging
bureaucratic compromise than from the mind of an all knowing deity with
total creative control&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;For those who are willing to adopt a view of probability as degree of belief
Bayes theorem can be seen not as a mere mathematical equation, but as a form
of mathematically flavored advice&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;

including depression and anxiety.  I'm not really sure if it's a
memoir or autobiography or neither, but you can think of it as a
series of blog posts about things that happen in her life, and her
thoughts.  It is &lt;em&gt;hilarious&lt;/em&gt;, and poignant, and helps people who don't
have disorders understand what's it like to have a disorder (I
think....I don't have a disorder, so can't confirm this, but I
definitely &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like I have a better understanding of them now).
She describes what it's like when they get especially bad in very
relatable ways, using experiences that most humans have had, and
without asking for pity.  It's also not just about feels and sad
things -- she narrates her life with silliness and humor, and many of
the experiences themselves are hilarious as well. From waking up to
find her arms are asleep, to having her daughter congratulate her on
making friends, Lawson talks about experiences we've all had without
fear of self-deprecation.  &amp;quot;Furiously Happy&amp;quot; is a fun and
thought-provoking read.  As a side note, I realize this whole post is
very effusive and only has nice things to say about the book. I
honestly have nothing bad to say about it. I expected it to be a quick
and funny read, and got &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more than I bargained for, which is just
about all you can ask of a book. As a sub-side-note, I highly
recommend the audio-book version as well. It's narrated by the author,
has several &amp;quot;extra&amp;quot; little bits in it, and Lawson's narration
definitely adds a lot to the experience of consuming the book.&lt;/p&gt;

We all do. The series has become an empire, with it's own movie series
and theme park, and no matter what subset of Harry Potter related
media you've experienced you have some thoughts about it. Regardless
of what those notions are -- good, bad, or ugly -- read on!  I have
had my own preconceptions about HP at various points in my life, and
after re-reading all seven books right in a row I can tell you that
many of them were turned upside down.  It may not be the series for
you, but before you go invest time in reading it, you may as well read
this way shorter blog post about it so you know what you're getting
into at least a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="preconceptions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Preconceptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many twenty-somethings, Harry Potter was the series of my
adolescence, and I grew up with Harry, Ron, and Hermione. I stood in
line for six hours to get the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th books, dressed as
a wizard and talking to other HP fans. I went to the midnight premier
of at least three of the movies.  I wasn't the most into it of all my
friends, but I drank the Kool-Aid. However, as I picked up the first
book again a few months ago I wasn't expecting Harry Potter to be a
great series.  I expected that they would be perfectly adequate tween
novels that I had loved in my youth but now, older and wiser, would
realize I had outgrown, like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Jackson_%26_the_Olympians"&gt;Percy Jackson&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.neopets.com"&gt;Neopets&lt;/a&gt;.  I'll get
to the chase you know is coming, reader: Harry Potter is not just a
kids book.  The characters are what make these books extraordinary, as
they are all layered, multidimensional, &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; people who reflect
modern society so well.  JK Rowling is able to capture the many ways
we judge other humans in her characters, and the lengths we'll go to
defend those judgements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-series"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Series&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the series is seven novels long, in reality it's one story
spanning seven years, that you do have to read in order and all of.
This isn't &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Ark"&gt;Animal Ark&lt;/a&gt; people.  There's no picking one book and
saying &amp;quot;Read this and you've read them all&amp;quot;.  That said, &lt;em&gt;it's 100%
worth it&lt;/em&gt;.  And I will say, some of the books are better than others.
My personal favorite was &amp;quot;The Half-Blood Prince&amp;quot;, but there is no
weak-link in the set, or book I finished and thought &amp;quot;Man, I really
hope the next one is better&amp;quot;. &lt;strong&gt;TL;DR Yes you have to read them all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-i-loved"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I loved&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Characters&lt;/strong&gt;. Growing up, all I remember is hating Snape. I had
no recollection of what an incredible character he is, so painfully
human and deeply entangled in the story.  The Malfoys, the Weasleys,
each delicately balanced between family and principles, conflicted
in how to choose what's best for those they love. So. Good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The HP Universe&lt;/strong&gt;.  JK Rowlings universe is very well thought out,
with details like government policy, racial prejudices, and even
the &lt;em&gt;botany&lt;/em&gt; of the universe created from scratch and implemented
perfectly.  Percy stresses about regulating cauldron-bottoms to be
thick enough. Neville knows the properties of Gillyweed and Devil's Snare.
History class is boring, standardized tests are stressful, and
non-wizards, muggle-born wizards, and women are all placed in a
social hierarchy similar to the racial strata that exists today.
The detail and consistency here is incredible, and makes the magical
world of Harry Potter that much more immersive and &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Form&lt;/strong&gt;.  Did you ever notice that there are no swear words in
Harry Potter?  And no modern technology more recent than a telephone or
TV, despite that these were written as iphones and laptops were
being developed and changing the world. It's executed so well that
you don't even notice.  There are prominent and powerful women,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Themes&lt;/strong&gt;. Rowling uses Harry Potter to explore coming of age,
racism and the hatred that arises from misunderstanding, corrupt
politics, greed, the psychology of abusive relationships, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's timeless&lt;/strong&gt;.  My second time through I feel as though I've barely scratched the
surface of deriving meaning from this series, and the layers of
complexity make this an excellent book for readers of all ages
and stages of life. I love that the series grows with you, taking
on new meaning each time it's revisited, and it makes me so excited
to read the series again in the future and see how it changes.  The
technology (or lack thereof) also adds to this timelessness, and
even a hundred years from now the books will still be just as relevant
and relatable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

this highly anticipated read, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Hunger-Makes-Me-Modern-Girl/dp/1594486638"&gt;Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl&lt;/a&gt; by
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.carriebrownstein.com/"&gt;Carrie Brownstein&lt;/a&gt;. Brownstein's memoir of her
time in the band &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sleater-kinney.com/"&gt;Sleater-Kinney&lt;/a&gt;, this book was raw to the point
of discomfort. Whatever opinions I may have, they're outweighed
by the respect I have for Brownstein's openness, vulnerability, and honesty.
The whole book, beginning to end, is one long intimate passage into
the private lives of herself, her family, and her bandmates, sharing
details I would cringe to tell my own friends, let alone publish
for the world to read. More than anything I'm in awe of her
talent for writing and fearless storytelling.  After the
amazement at her baring-all, though, I had a few other thoughts
on the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went in with few expectations and
scattered knowledge of Carrie Brownstein. I knew from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/"&gt;All Songs Considered&lt;/a&gt;
that she was a member of Sleater-Kinney, that she had worked briefly
for that podcast, and of course knew about her role in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ifc.com/shows/portlandia"&gt;Portlandia&lt;/a&gt;.
But I had never listened to Sleater-Kinney's music, much less studied their
past or had any part in the Pacific Northwest punk scene. In hindsight,
doing a little bit of studying before hand would have been helpful --
the book catalogs her experiences before, during, and briefly after
Sleater-Kinney exclusively, and she frequently references bands and
events I had never heard of, despite being so geographically and
temporally close to them.  This was a bug and a feature: knowing so
little made the book more educational, interesting, and worthwhile,
but also in many ways less meaningful or impactful for me personally.
That said, Brownstein includes so much more than just a history of
the band.  Her struggles with anxiety and depression, a variety
of physical conditions including shingles and an allergy to soy,
and hypochondria while touring with a band, are very much relatable
to any who has battled those same battles. She also speaks at length
of coming of age and finding what she wanted to do, of how her parents
own repressed selves affected her childhood, and of other
profound thoughts on the human experience in the modern age, and how
to navigate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, &amp;quot;Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl&amp;quot; was an enjoyable
and worthwhile read. Entertaining, insightful, and almost unbearably
honest, I would highly recommend picking this up if you have a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

One by Ernest Cline&lt;/a&gt;.  Set 30 years in the future, Ready Player One
depicts a bleak distopia where a MMORPG (massively multiplayer online
role playing game) called the OASIS is the only escape from reality,
and has in fact replaced it.  The novel follows teenager Wade Watts
through a Hunger Games-esque competition requiring expansive and
detailed knowledge of 80's tech culture, from video games to movies to
comic books and beyond.  This is a total candy read, and if you're
into science fiction or Neal Stephenson novels (particularly
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Reamde-A-Novel-Neal-Stephenson/dp/0062191497"&gt;Reamde&lt;/a&gt;), this would definitely be a good weekend pick-me-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, it didn't hit my literary sweet spot, but then again I
can't say I expected it to. I will say it was much more accessible
than I expected it to be, and aligned perfectly with my values:
intellect winning out over money; strong, rich, diverse characters;
well researched but not obscure.  Candy Read.  Without giving too much
away (fear not, read on), what made it most enjoyable was the very
distinct Good vs. Evil dynamic, and how each party was very clearly on
one side or the other. It was easy to root for the the protagonists,
against the antagonists, and just be along for the plot-ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's all she wrote.  My next review will be sometime next week
on Carrie Brownstein's memoir &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Hunger-Makes-Me-Modern-Girl/dp/1594486638"&gt;Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
