Summer is upon us, and with long sunny days ahead
you know you'll be tripping to Powell's to pick up some summer reads.
I wanted to make this a regular reading list with a variety of ficiton
and nonfiction books, and I realized that 90% of my choices were
biographies or memoirs.  If you're not into them, don't despair! There are
a few fictional masterpieces sprinkled in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_potter_series"&gt;The Harry Potter Series&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on your appetite this series can take
a while, but I recently re-read the whole series and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lucywyman.me/harry-potter-series.html"&gt;loved it&lt;/a&gt;. Definitely
worth revisiting if you haven't in a while, or if you've never read them
to begin with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Help"&gt;The Help&lt;/a&gt;. If you haven't already, you should.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_Weapons"&gt;Use of Weapons&lt;/a&gt;. Even if you aren't familiar with the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_series"&gt;Culture series&lt;/a&gt;,
and don't want to read all 9 books, Use of Weapons is a fantastic stand alone
novel.  The chapters alternate between going forwards in time and backwards,
the characters are impossibly rich and well written, and the twist at the
end will leave you speechless and teary-eyed. Even if you're not a sci-fi
buff, definitely worth reading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/books/committed-a-love-story/"&gt;Committed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/"&gt;Big Magic&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/books/eat-pray-love/"&gt;Eat, Pray, Love&lt;/a&gt;.
You've definitely heard of the last one, but
the first is &lt;em&gt;so much better&lt;/em&gt;. Elizabeth Gilbert is 100% my favorite author,
my guilty pleasure, my comfort food, and her voice is miraculous. I like her
non-fiction better than her fiction (just personally, no literary criticism
here), but anything she writes will definitely lift your day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://thebloggess.com/furiously-happy/"&gt;Furiously Happy&lt;/a&gt;. I'm not sure if this qualifies as a biography, but it
seems close enough. I've read &lt;em&gt;several&lt;/em&gt; comedic ladies biographies (
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/books/bossypants-by-tina-fey-review.html"&gt;Bossypants&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://amysaysyesplease.com/"&gt;Yes Please&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11230081-seriously-i-m-kidding"&gt;Seriously, I'm Kidding&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.avclub.com/review/mindy-kalingem-is-everyone-hanging-out-without-me--64875"&gt;Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) and though hilarious and
inspiring I find the story often gets lost in the authors trying to be
funny. Granted being funny in writing (even in an audiobook) is like marathon
level hard. But &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://thebloggess.com/"&gt;Jenny Lawson&lt;/a&gt; definitely pulls it off in her reading of
her second book &amp;quot;Furiously Happy&amp;quot;, and includes a lot of personal moments
that help plebs like me understand mental illness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://lisagenova.com/still-alice/"&gt;Still Alice&lt;/a&gt;. It's so hard to understand living with mental illness, and
Still Alice paints a vivid picture of life with early onset Alzheimers.
There were so many points where you think &amp;quot;This could be me, or someone
I love&amp;quot;, and it gives you real empathy and compassion for those battling
mental illness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://piperkerman.com/orange/about-the-book/"&gt;Orange is the New Black&lt;/a&gt;. I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; the show, but it definitely takes
a lot of artistic license. Piper's actual experience, though less exciting,
is fascinating and well-told.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anything by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sedaris#Bibliography"&gt;David Sedaris&lt;/a&gt;. I especially love &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holidays_on_Ice"&gt;Holidays on Ice&lt;/a&gt;, if you're
a Sedaris newbie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Audacity_of_Hope"&gt;The Audacity of Hope&lt;/a&gt;. Perfect for a quick weekend read, Obama's cool
personal story and charismatic voice make this feel good, palate-cleanser
sort of book. Remind yourself there's good in the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
