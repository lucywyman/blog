technical bits from a variety of news podcasts -- basically a curated, audio
Hacker News.  This past week, everyone has been
FREAKING OUT about the WFC fight of the century, Apple vs. FBI, in a
non-stop stream of uninformed (or worse, half-informed) newscasters questioning
whether Apple is doing the right thing by protecting their users privacy*.
However, in the breaths between FREAKING OUT, there were a few bits on
self-driving cars, and whether America is ready for them.  The bit focused
on folks saying they didn't trust self-driving cars&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'll spare you the drama and to say I side very strongly with Apple, and
if you don't care to read more about the issue you should as well.  Take
it from an engineer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
