feel good, and that endorphin rush just can't be beat. However, since
I typically run early in the morning and listen to murder podcasts I
opt to use the elliptical at the gym in the mornings in place of
running. That said, this playlist is definitely applicable to whatever
cardio you're doing: running, elliptical, even biking! I have these in
a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/12152465230/playlist/559vjV4H1kJqp3ViHU93bD"&gt;spotify playlist&lt;/a&gt; (which gets updated frequently as I get bored of
songs), and generally just hit 'shuffle', but you could definitely
construct a more structured workout if you'd like. Anywho, finding
tempo songs that I like to workout to is a hard task, and I wanted to
provide my own list of songs that work for me and my pace (~9 minute
miles). Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="hills-120-140-bpm"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hills (120-140 BPM)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these songs also make great sprints! I sprint during the
chorus, when the songs tend to get faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;120 BPM     3:43    &amp;quot;Papi&amp;quot; by Jennifer Lopez&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mid-Tempo (140-160 BPM)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fast-Tempo (160-180 BPM)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The push-yourself, all-out songs. This is where the real work out is!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joy is my QUEEN! I've never made a recipe of hers that I didn't like,
and her go-with-the-flow, you-only-live-once-so-make-the-best-of-it
way of living is truly inspiring.  She posts &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://joythebaker.com/recipe-index-2/"&gt;great, easy recipes&lt;/a&gt;
(and some &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://joythebaker.com/2016/12/king-arthur-flour-cream-cheese-cinnamon-rolls/"&gt;baking adventures&lt;/a&gt;), and includes a weekly post of
articles from around the internet. She's a true joy (ha) to read and
bake with!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="minimalist-baker"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://minimalistbaker.com/"&gt;Minimalist Baker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I don't necessarily love reading Dana's posts so much, I do love
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://instagram.com/minimalistbaker/"&gt;her instagram&lt;/a&gt; and the incredible arsenal of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://minimalistbaker.com/recipe-index/"&gt;recipes&lt;/a&gt; she's
amassed on her site. Her food photography is beautiful, and you can
find healthy (for whatever healthy means to you!), tasty, and
satisfying recipes on her blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://witanddelight.com/"&gt;Wit &amp;amp; Delight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is considered a 'design' blog, but honestly most of their
posts are just stories about being a human in the world. I love W+D
for connecting me to other women around the world and understanding
what's on their mind. What's it like to start dating again at 40?
What's it like to have a miscarriage? What &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; happen when you tried
not wearing a bra for 30 days? Understanding others experience through
beautiful story-telling; my kind of blog!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-cup-of-jo"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://cupofjo.com/"&gt;A Cup of Jo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd describe Cup of Jo as 'a little bit of everything'. Her posts are
typically short and casual, almost like checking in with a friend once
every few days, and Joanna has created a wonderful community of
uplifting women. I love that Cup of Jo isn't &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to be anything,
or telling you how to live your life. It's just an upbeat check in, a
&amp;quot;y'know what I was thinking about earlier today&amp;quot;. I don't know. It's
hard to describe. I highly recommend it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="carly-the-prepster"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.carlytheprepster.com/"&gt;Carly the Prepster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does anyone else go through weird periods of obsession with a
particular &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; (song, movie, artist, etc.)? I'm currently crushing
&lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; on Carly. I know it's a phase and that it will pass, but for
now I just love reading her blog and following her on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/carly/"&gt;insta&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/collegeprepster"&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;. She just seems so kind and upbeat, put-together without
being overly primped, and I love her sense of style. I don't typically
think of myself as a 'preppy' person, and wouldn't spend as much money
as I think she does on my closet, so my obsession seems a little...out
of left field. But for now I'm going with it! (And actually, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnX9INqSflA"&gt;this
video&lt;/a&gt; inspired me to start trying to blog more!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="nyt-tip-column"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/magazine-tip"&gt;NYT Tip Column&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About once a week the NYT will post a short column with basic tips on
how to do something. This week it was &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/magazine/how-to-take-a-vow-of-silence.html"&gt;How to Take a Vow of Silence&lt;/a&gt;.
It can be anything. How to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/magazine/how-to-climb-a-coconut-tree.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fmagazine-tip"&gt;climb a coconut tree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/magazine/how-to-eat-spicy-food.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fmagazine-tip"&gt;write a love letter&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/magazine/how-to-write-a-love-letter.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fmagazine-tip"&gt;eat spicy foods&lt;/a&gt;. I love spending a little time
each week pondering following the advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="young-house-love"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.younghouselove.com/"&gt;Young House Love&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned John and Sherry's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.younghouselove.com/category/podcast/"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; in my list of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.lucywyman.me/podcasts.html"&gt;favorite
podcasts&lt;/a&gt; a while back, and while their banter on air cannot be beat
I also enjoy reading their blog! While they are much more handy and
DIY than I ever expect to be, it's very fun to see the projects they
take on. This is the only real 'home design' blog I read, and it's a
good exercise in contemplating the space I'm in. I also love their
upbeat attitudes, and reading about their lovely family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="money"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="frugalwoods"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.frugalwoods.com/"&gt;Frugalwoods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Frugalwoods live a life of frugal luxury on a homestead in Vermont, where
Mrs. Frugalwoods write funny and hearty soliloquies on personal finance,
answers reader questions, and describes their lives in rural Vermont. I love
Mrs. Frugalwoods writing style, and her positive attitude towards frugality.
It's hard to put my finger on what in her voice and content resonates so much
with me, but she is hands down one of my favorite writers of any platform. I
highly recommend if you're looking to up your financial game (or like
beautiful pictures of rural New England).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="mr-money-mustache"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mrmoneymustache.com/"&gt;Mr. Money Mustache&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MMM is THE personal finance blogger, at least in the nerdy circles I run in.
And for good reason: his approach is very similar to the Frugalwoods, which
is living below your means, spending on what matters to you, and growing your
money correctly. MMM is definitely a bit snarkier than the Frugalwoods, but
also has great writing style and aligns very strongly with my personal
values. Preach!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-power-of-thrift"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://thepowerofthrift.com"&gt;The Power of Thrift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Anita doesn't always (or even often) blog about finance, I honestly really like reading about her day to day life, her goals, and the books she's reading. More of a lifestyle blog than a financial blog, but very much like catching up with a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="fashion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fashion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="style-bee"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Style Bee&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEE. Like so many, I was enamoured with Caroline Rector of Un-fancy (see
below) for years until she teamed up with Lee of Style Bee. And my life
changed forever. Lee is an ethical fashion blogger, and her style is
&lt;em&gt;incredible&lt;/em&gt;. If I could style myself half that well...Lee is the best way to
learn about responsible fashion brands, and see them styled + modeled. I love
love love her blog, and can't wait to read more now that she's a full time
blogger!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="un-fancy"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Un-Fancy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OG in ethical fashion blogging (at least to me), Caroline has pretty much
stopped blogging at this point. But it's still fun to read through the
archives of her capsule wardrobes, and be inspired by her amazing photography
and closet. An oldie but a goodie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's it! My favorite blogs to read. I hope you found one that you will fall in love with or be inspired by!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Powell's remains a thriving hub of literature.  Even if you haven't
picked up a book in years, Powell's will remind you of the power books
have over us, and make you thirsty for knowledge.  You'll be wandering
aimlessly, not sure what there is for you there, then find yourself
thinking 'I bet that vegetarian cookbook would help me cook at home
more instead of getting takeout', or 'Oooo, I haven't read Phillip K.
Dick in years. I used to love his books', and the game is over. The
book worm, occasional beach reader, skeptical technophile,
wonder-filled child, and dormant literature lover will inevitably find
themselves drawn to one of Powell's 1 million books and fall in love
all over again.  Even if you just come for the corgi-socks, it's worth
the visit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="rose-test-garden"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Rose Test Garden&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Rose Test Garden is one of the most traditionally
beautiful places in Portland.  With several football fields of roses
and several hundred million types of roses, it's easy to lose all
sense of time and space amidst the fragrance and brilliance of the
Rose Test Garden. All kidding aside, the RTG is a must during the
summer months when roses are in full bloom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="serra"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://shopserra.com/"&gt;Serra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right, marijuana is legal in Oregon now, which has resulted in
some of the &lt;em&gt;cutest&lt;/em&gt; and friendliest shops popping up around town. I
think there are a few things that make marijuana shops super great:
1. They're combatting some pretty harsh cultural taboos. Pot is still frequently seen as &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; or seedy (see my parents reaction when they read this post), so the best marijuana stores combat that by being very well lit, open spaces that are &lt;em&gt;beautifully&lt;/em&gt; designed. The staff are often very friendly and knowledgeable too, so you don't need to feel uncool for asking a million questions or leave without knowing what you're putting in your body.
2. Everything is local, by necessity. Because marijuana isn't legal in other states it can't cross state lines, even if it's legal in both of those states (ie. Oregon and Washington). This means you're by default supporting amazing local businesses who are often supplying 100% locally made and extremely high quality products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love Serra because it epitomizes both of these qualities. All of
their shops are in gorgeous old buildings, and are staffed with folks
who will stand there for &lt;em&gt;literally hours&lt;/em&gt; answering all your
questions about strains and chemicals and neurology and side effects.
And honestly you guys, I like consuming (not smoking) marijuana &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt;
much more than drinking. Beyond a glass or two of wine alcohol really
doesn't agree with my system, and has ruined a few nights and
mornings. Marijuana doesn't have those terrible physical side
effects, and provides equally enjoyable inebriation in the right
doses. If you're in town and haven't tried it yet, I highly (ha)
recommend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bagdad-theater"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.mcmenamins.com/bagdad-theater-pub"&gt;Bagdad Theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.mcmenamins.com/"&gt;McMenamin's&lt;/a&gt; is more than a brewery, but an eclectic variety of
refurbished vintage buildings providing places for communities to
gather. The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.mcmenamins.com/bagdad-theater-pub"&gt;Bagdad Theater&lt;/a&gt; is one such place. Located at the heart of
Hawthorne, the Bagdad is the perfect &amp;quot;Portland&amp;quot; place for dinner, a
movie, or both! When my SO was living in Portland over the summer we
would go there almost every Saturday, get a large order of tater tots,
and enjoy the movies they screened there. It's a staple of our lives,
and a staple of Portland culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ground-kontrol"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://groundkontrol.com/"&gt;Ground Kontrol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most big cities have classic arcades, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://groundkontrol.com/"&gt;Ground Kontrol&lt;/a&gt; is ours.
With about a million pinball machines, classics like DDR and
Ms.Pacman, and newer games like Killer Queen, GK has something for
everyone. Bring your quarters and forget your troubles for a few
hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="food"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="e-san-thai"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://esanthai.com/"&gt;E-San Thai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The food may just be OK, but E-San has a special place in my heart.
My co-workers and I often go there for lunch on Fridays, and I have so
many fond memories of us squeezing 10-18 people into their loft,
laughing together and enjoying a meal. I always get the same thing
(Pad See Ew with Carrots) and have never tired of it! It may seem
blase at first, but take your time at E-San. Admire the old wood and
sturdy construction, the elaborate decorations, the scratches in the
tables and floor that let you know this place is &lt;em&gt;lived in&lt;/em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="dc-vegetarian"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dcvegetarian.com/"&gt;DC Vegetarian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portland is also known for it's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.foodcartsportland.com/"&gt;Food Carts&lt;/a&gt;, and while I can't say
I've tried enough to tell you what that best in the city are, I will
tell you that whenever I go to a food cart for lunch it is always to
DC Vegetarian on 3rd and Alder. Their vegetarian and vegan
sandwiches are better than their meaty counterparts, and my
go-to meal is just $5.50, the cheapest lunch you can get downtown at
lunch hour. I highly recommend the vegan BLT, with avocado of course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="blue-star-donuts"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.bluestardonuts.com/"&gt;Blue Star Donuts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's my duty as a native Portlander to tell you that &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.voodoodoughnut.com/"&gt;VooDoo donuts&lt;/a&gt; are
entirely overrated, and that if you really want the Portland Donut
Experience you absolutely must go to Blue Star. With classic and
exotic flavors, Blue Star donuts are fresh and doughy, not too sweet,
and 100% satisfying. My personal favorite is the Blueberry Bourbon
Basil, but you'll just have to try them all to see which is your
favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="cacao"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cacaodrinkchocolate.com/"&gt;Cacao&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drinkable. Chocolate. Need I say more? Cacao is a super fancy
chocolate place, with a few locations throughout Portland. They have
all the high-quality chocolate your heart could desire, fancy people
who use words like &amp;quot;earthy&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;floral&amp;quot; to tell you about it, and did
I mention the drinkable chocolate?  Warning: you will be consistently
disappointed in hot chocolate after going here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this post is not to enumerate the top 10 podcasts that you
already listen to, but to tell you about some lesser-known podcasts that I
&lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt;. In no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ohnopodcast.com/"&gt;Oh No Ross and Carrie&lt;/a&gt; -- the show where they don't just report on

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this post is not to enumerate the top 10 podcasts that you
already listen to, but to tell you about some lesser-known podcasts that I
&lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt;. In no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ohnopodcast.com/"&gt;Oh No Ross and Carrie&lt;/a&gt; -- the show where they don't just report on
fringe science, spirituality, and claims of the paranormal, but take
part themselves! Honestly, whether you enjoy hearing about UFO
conferences and acupuncture or not, Ross and Carrie are 2 of the
loveliest people you'll listen to. They're who I listen to when I've
had a particularly stressful day, and need a few deep breaths of
fresh air.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolabmoreperfect/"&gt;More Perfect&lt;/a&gt;, the podcast about the Supreme Court, by Radio Lab.
Though often a bit depressing (aren't stories about people with
power always depressing?), More Perfect is very well researched,
high quality, and relevant pod.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.younghouselove.com/category/podcast/"&gt;Young House Love Has A Podcast&lt;/a&gt;. I'm honestly not very 'into' interior
design or home stuff, but I love this couples' banter and their
relationship. In it for the laughs, with some tips about lighting on
the side :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gimletmedia.com/show/mystery-show/"&gt;The Mystery Show&lt;/a&gt;. Starlee Kine, who you've definitely
heard on This American Life, solves mysteries that can't be
solved online. These aren't the &amp;quot;Who was that guy in that movie?&amp;quot;
questions, but questions like &amp;quot;There's one photo of Britney Spears
holding a book that only sold 100 copies. How did she get a hold of
it?&amp;quot; kind of questions. It may sound like a strange and unlikely
premise, but Starlee executes it &lt;em&gt;perfectly&lt;/em&gt;, and has definitely
mastered storytelling.  She's also a delightful narrator, and her
conversations with people are among the most interesting parts of
the show. She's so interested in the lives of the people she talks
to, and even without the mystery part just listening to her interact
with other humans is inspiring.  All in all, one of the best podcast
finds of the last year.  There are only 6 episodes, and it seems to
have gone offline, but never lose hope!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gimletmedia.com/show/reply-all"&gt;Reply All&lt;/a&gt;. Hosted by PJ Vogt (pronounced &amp;quot;vote&amp;quot;) and
Alex Goldman, Reply All is a show about the internet.  With
top-notch banter and interesting topics, I've learned a lot from
Reply All (mostly about twitter, but also about who invented email
and how terrorists communicate) and laughed out loud in very public
places.  Even if you're not a &amp;quot;techie&amp;quot; Reply All will probably float
your boat.  Try a few episodes, then write me a thank you note.
You're welcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/dopequeens/"&gt;2 Dope Queens&lt;/a&gt;. A new comedy podcast, 2 Dope Queens
is live comedy hosted by Phoebe Robinson and Jessica Williams. It's
a nice break from the more serious podcasts, and as a comedy-world
newbie I find myself laughing out loud multiple times during each
episode.  Whether you already have a favorite comedy podcast or not,
I would highly recommend giving 2DQ a try (obviously, it's on this
list).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.wbur.org/series/dear-sugar"&gt;Dear Sugar Radio&lt;/a&gt;. DSR is one of my newer finds, and I've fallen
in love.  Hosted by Cheryl Strayed and Steve Almond, DSR cover
universal topics like infidelity, lying, and other struggles we all
experience by reading and answering letters from listeners. I grew
up listening to Dr. Laura with my mom, and have seen the light!
There is a better way! And this podcast is it. Like, imagine Dr.
Laura hosted by nice and reasonable people instead of mean | crazy |
racist people.  It's honey in my life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://howtodoeverything.org/"&gt;How To Do Everything&lt;/a&gt;. This show is just a way better version of
Stuff You Should Know.  This podcast is the Mecca of banter, the
banter that every duo aspires to, the kind of banter that
&lt;em&gt;inspires&lt;/em&gt;.  They also cover all types of questions, calling experts
to answer questions like whether dolphins sleep, if wasps can
recognize each other, and how to do arm-farts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://getcrookedmedia.com/here-have-a-podcast-78ee56b5a323"&gt;Pod Save America&lt;/a&gt;. Former speech writers for the Obama administration
discuss current political events and interview prominent political
figures. A nice breath of fresh, democratic air during troubling times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://kexp.org/podcasts"&gt;KEXP Music That Matters&lt;/a&gt;. Spotify Discovery Weekly not doing it
for you?  Each week they put out a curated playlist centered on a
theme, and the music ranges from punk to hard rock to folk to pop to
country and beyond.  Some are great, some aren't, but it's worth
wading through the rough stuff to find the gems. They also tend to
focus on artists local to the PNW, which means it's a great way for
me to find shows playing in the area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Podcasts I Listen To That You Probably Do Too:
These are in the order from favorite to least favorite, though if
I didn't like any of them I just wouldn't listen to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.myfavoritemurder.com/"&gt;My Favorite Murder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

at least 5 days a week.  For more than 30 years. And it shows -- she has
great blood pressure, a healthy heart rate, and can walk way farther and longer
than my brother or I (seriously, bring comfortable walking shoes if you
ever go on vacation with us. Lessons learned the hard way.).  In fact,
a few years ago my mom had her gallbladder removed, came home and
cooked dinner &lt;em&gt;that night&lt;/em&gt;. If that's not strong and healthy, call me
a monkey's uncle.  She also eats what she wants, when she wants, to
help her body feel good.  From not having a scale in the house, to
prioritizing intellect and personality over looks, to
emphasizing exercise and good food, my mom built an ideal body-image
foundation.  This isn't to say I've always had a healthy
relationship with food, but it's been easy to develop one.  I'm
so grateful to my mom for helping me see that your waistline
doesn't indicate how healthy you are, that big hispanic booties
are a great ass-et, and that exercising and eating to feel good
will make me way happeir (and healthier) than dieting ever will.&lt;/p&gt;
