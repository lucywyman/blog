generally Having a Great Mom, or something, I wanted to give my mom a
shoutout for teaching me that happy + healthy &amp;gt; skinny.  My mom works &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;
for her body, doing an hour-long cardio and strength class (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.jazzercise.com/"&gt;Jazzercise&lt;/a&gt;)
at least 5 days a week.  For more than 30 years. And it shows -- she has
great blood pressure, a healthy heart rate, and can walk way farther and longer
than my brother or I (seriously, bring comfortable walking shoes if you
ever go on vacation with us. Lessons learned the hard way.).  In fact,
a few years ago my mom had her gallbladder removed, came home and
cooked dinner &lt;em&gt;that night&lt;/em&gt;. If that's not strong and healthy, call me
a monkey's uncle.  She also eats what she wants, when she wants, to
help her body feel good.  From not having a scale in the house, to
prioritizing intellect and personality over looks, to
emphasizing exercise and good food, my mom built an ideal body-image
foundation.  This isn't to say I've always had a healthy
relationship with food, but it's been easy to develop one.  I'm
so grateful to my mom for helping me see that your waistline
doesn't indicate how healthy you are, that big hispanic booties
are a great ass-et, and that exercising and eating to feel good
will make me way happeir (and healthier) than dieting ever will.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a living list of media that has significantly
changed my life in some way. Whether clarifying values I held, inspiring
me to change my thoughts or actions, or teaching me , the experiences below
are ones that have helped shape me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Committed-Love-Story-Elizabeth-Gilbert/dp/0143118706"&gt;&amp;quot;Committed&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Gilbert"&gt;Elizabeth Gilbert&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jesslively.com/livelyshow"&gt;Jess Lively's The Lively Show&lt;/a&gt;.  Jess's positivity and guests
never fail to pull me out of a bad mood, and especially in an industry
so dominated by men hearing from working women is incredibly inspiring
and uplifting.  From &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jesslively.com/carolinerector/"&gt;capsule wardrobes&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jesslively.com/decemberfavorites2015/"&gt;focusing on pleasure&lt;/a&gt; to
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jesslively.com/gratitude-and-asking/"&gt;being grateful&lt;/a&gt;, her shows have helped me so much this last year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://recipes.lucywyman.me/cheesy-pasta.html"&gt;Cheesy Baked Pasta&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://chocolatecoveredkatie.com"&gt;Chocolate-Covered Katie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The album &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Pageant-Material-Kacey-Musgraves/dp/B00XJJAWES"&gt;Pageant Material&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.kaceymusgraves.com/"&gt;Kacey Musgraves&lt;/a&gt;. No matter how many
times I listen to this album, it always comforts and centers me.&lt;/li&gt;
