listen to, but to tell you about some lesser-known podcasts that I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gimletmedia.com/show/mystery-show/"&gt;The Mystery Show&lt;/a&gt;. Starlee Kine, who you've definitely
heard on This American Life (?), solves mysteries that can't be solved
online. These aren't the &amp;quot;Who was that guy in that movie?&amp;quot; questions, but
questions like &amp;quot;There's one photo of Britney Spears holding a book that only
sold 100 copies. How did she get a hold of it?&amp;quot; kind of questions. It may
sound like a strange and unlikely premise, but Starlee executes it
&lt;em&gt;perfectly&lt;/em&gt;, and has definitely mastered storytelling.  She's also a
delightful narrator, and her conversations with people are among the most
interesting parts of the show. She's so interested in the lives of the people
she talks to, and even without the mystery part just listening to her
interact with other humans is inspiring.  All in all, one of the best podcast
finds of the last year.  It's still pretty new, so catch up while you can!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gimletmedia.com/show/reply-all"&gt;Reply All&lt;/a&gt;. Hosted by PJ Vogt (pronounced &amp;quot;vote&amp;quot;) and
Alex Goldman, Reply All is a show about the internet.  With top-notch banter
and interesting topics, I've learned a lot from Reply All (mostly about
twitter, but also about who invented email and how terrorists communicate)
and laughed out loud in very public places.  Even if you're not a &amp;quot;techie&amp;quot;
Reply All will probably float your boat.  Try a few episodes, then write me a
thank you note. You're welcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/dopequeens/"&gt;2 Dope Queens&lt;/a&gt;. A new comedy podcast, 2 Dope Queens
is live comedy hosted by Phoebe Robinson and Jessica Williams. It's a nice
break from the more serious podcasts, and as a comedy-world newbie I find
myself laughing out loud multiple times during each episode.  Whether you
already have a favorite comedy podcast or not, I would highly recommend
giving 2DQ a try (obviously, it's on this list).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.mythpodcast.com/"&gt;Myths and Legends&lt;/a&gt;. Hosted by a guy named Jason, the about page
says it best: &amp;quot;This is a weekly podcast telling legendary stories as closely
to the originals as possible. Some are incredibly popular stories you think
you know, but with surprising origins. Others are stories that might be new
to you, but are definitely worth a listen.&amp;quot; Jason weaves in his own analysis
and comments into his unique telling of each story, and the final product is
a highly entertaining, interesting, and educational 30-minute show.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.wbur.org/series/dear-sugar"&gt;Dear Sugar Radio&lt;/a&gt;. DSR is one of my newer finds, and I've fallen in love.
Hosted by Cheryl Strayed and Steve Almond, DSR cover universal topics like
infidelity, lying, and other struggles we all experience by reading and answering
letters from listeners. I grew up listening to Dr. Laura with my mom, and
have seen the light! There is a better way! And this podcast is it. Like,
imagine Dr. Laura hosted by nice and reasonable people instead of mean | crazy |
racist people.  It's honey in my life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://howtodoeverything.org/"&gt;How To Do Everything&lt;/a&gt;. This show is just a way better version of
Stuff You Should Know.  This podcast is the Mecca of banter, the
banter that every duo aspires to, the kind of banter that &lt;em&gt;inspires&lt;/em&gt;.
They also cover all types of questions, calling experts to answer
questions like whether dolphins sleep, if wasps can recognize each other,
and how to do arm-farts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jesslively.com/livelyshow/"&gt;The Jess Lively Show&lt;/a&gt;.  I've already written about this in my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://kexp.org/podcasts"&gt;favorite things post&lt;/a&gt;,
but I'll say it here again: Jess Lively's Show has changed my life!  I move
through the world with so much more intention and purpose, have discovered
values I didn't even know I had, and am generally heartened and inspired by
her and her guests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://kexp.org/podcasts"&gt;KEXP Music That Matters&lt;/a&gt;. Spotify Discovery Weekly not doing it for you?
Each week they put out a curated playlist centered on a theme, and the music
ranges from punk to hard rock to folk to pop to country and beyond.  Some
are great, some aren't, but it's worth wading through the rough stuff
to find the gems. They also tend to focus on artists local to the PNW,
which means it's a great way for me to find shows playing in the area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Podcasts I Listen To That You Probably Do Too:
These are in the order from favorite to least favorite, though if
I didn't like any of them I just wouldn't listen to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/"&gt;This American Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/"&gt;All Songs Considered&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/sections/money/"&gt;Planet Money&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.radiolab.org/"&gt;RadioLab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://loveandradio.org/"&gt;Love + Radio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://freakonomics.com/category/podcasts/"&gt;Freakonomics Radio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any other recommendations for this list, please let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

generally Having a Great Mom, or something, I wanted to give my mom a
shoutout for teaching me that happy + healthy &amp;gt; skinny.  My mom works &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;
for her body, doing an hour-long cardio and strength class (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.jazzercise.com/"&gt;Jazzercise&lt;/a&gt;)
at least 5 days a week.  For more than 30 years. And it shows -- she has
great blood pressure, a healthy heart rate, and can walk way farther and longer
than my brother or I (seriously, bring comfortable walking shoes if you
ever go on vacation with us. Lessons learned the hard way.).  In fact,
a few years ago my mom had her gallbladder removed, came home and
cooked dinner &lt;em&gt;that night&lt;/em&gt;. If that's not strong and healthy, call me
a monkey's uncle.  She also eats what she wants, when she wants, to
help her body feel good.  From not having a scale in the house, to
prioritizing intellect and personality over looks, to
emphasizing exercise and good food, my mom built an ideal body-image
foundation.  This isn't to say I've always had a healthy
relationship with food, but it's been easy to develop one.  I'm
so grateful to my mom for helping me see that your waistline
doesn't indicate how healthy you are, that big hispanic booties
are a great ass-et, and that exercising and eating to feel good
will make me way happeir (and healthier) than dieting ever will.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a living list of media that has significantly
changed my life in some way. Whether clarifying values I held, inspiring
me to change my thoughts or actions, or teaching me , the experiences below
are ones that have helped shape me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Committed-Love-Story-Elizabeth-Gilbert/dp/0143118706"&gt;&amp;quot;Committed&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Gilbert"&gt;Elizabeth Gilbert&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jesslively.com/livelyshow"&gt;Jess Lively's The Lively Show&lt;/a&gt;.  Jess's positivity and guests
never fail to pull me out of a bad mood, and especially in an industry
so dominated by men hearing from working women is incredibly inspiring
and uplifting.  From &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jesslively.com/carolinerector/"&gt;capsule wardrobes&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jesslively.com/decemberfavorites2015/"&gt;focusing on pleasure&lt;/a&gt; to
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jesslively.com/gratitude-and-asking/"&gt;being grateful&lt;/a&gt;, her shows have helped me so much this last year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://recipes.lucywyman.me/cheesy-pasta.html"&gt;Cheesy Baked Pasta&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://chocolatecoveredkatie.com"&gt;Chocolate-Covered Katie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The album &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Pageant-Material-Kacey-Musgraves/dp/B00XJJAWES"&gt;Pageant Material&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.kaceymusgraves.com/"&gt;Kacey Musgraves&lt;/a&gt;. No matter how many
times I listen to this album, it always comforts and centers me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/toby_littledude/?hl=en"&gt;Toby Littledude&lt;/a&gt;.  Make sure you read the captions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://magnoliamarket.com/fixer-upper/"&gt;Fixer Upper&lt;/a&gt; with Chip and Joanna Gaines. The CUTEST show, with great
home makeovers that will inspire you to learn more about home improvement!
It's a little tough to watch while renting a basement.&lt;/li&gt;
