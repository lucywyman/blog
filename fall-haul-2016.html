<h2>Pre-Fall Haul 2016</h2>
<p>09.10.2016</p>
<img alt="" src="/theme/images/fall-haul-2016.jpg" style="height: 400px;">
<p>Over the last few weeks I've been assessing my wardrobe, pruning
things that I don't need or wear and deciding what's missing or needs
an upgrade.  After researching <a class="reference external" href="http://www.un-fancy.com/capsule-experiment/">capsule wardrobes</a> for hours and
filling out <a class="reference external" href="http://www.un-fancy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/capsuleplanner_2016.pdf">Caroline Rector's Capsule Planner</a>, I found
a color palette that most of my closet fit into and a few essentials
that I was in need of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>2 pairs of jeans. At the time I had 3, which just wasn't enough now
that I wear them most days.</li>
<li>Sweaters. I only have 1 (!) sweater, and since I get cold so easily
I knew I needed more (how did I even survive last winter???)</li>
<li>A light raincoat. I have a heavy-duty trench perfect for those
really bad days, but am lacking a light water-proof coat for those
mild-but-wet days.</li>
<li>A flannel. I've never considered myself a flannel person, but
thought it was worth trying this season.</li>
<li>Flats!  I've always just bought cheap plastic flats from Payless,
getting new ones every 3-9 months, and decided it was time to stop
that nonsense.</li>
</ul>
<p>So! Shopping list in hand, mom and I headed to the Woodburn Outlet
mall for some serious shopping.  4 hours and infinite dressing rooms
later, we emerged elated and victorious!  Here's what I got:</p>
<div class="figure align-center">

</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>2 pairs of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ghbass.com/product/susie+casual+flat.do?sortby=ourPicks&amp;from=fn">Susie Casual Flats</a>, one in black and one in red ($12 each)</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.ghbass.com/product/matilda+flat+ii.do?sortby=ourPicks&amp;from=fn">The Matilda Flat</a> in black ($48) and cognac ($12)</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.levi.com/US/en_US/womens-jeans/p/188820023">Levi's High Rise Skinny Jeans</a> ($40)</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.ae.com/women-aeo-crew-jegging-sweater-purple/web/s-prod/0348_7204_500?cm=sUS-cUSD&amp;catId=cat6470515">Crew Sweater</a> from American Eagle in Burgundy($40)</li>
<li>Flannel from American Eagle in Navy ($35) (not available online)</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.madewell.com/madewell_category/DENIMBAR/highriseskinnyjeans/PRDOVR~E0494/E0494.jsp">Madewell 10&quot; High Rise Skinny Jeans</a> ($40 on super sale in store!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Coming in at just under $250, this may have been one of my most
successful shopping trips EVER!  Shopping intentionally, with a
cohesive and functional wardrobe in mind was much more gratifying and
useful than just buying things I liked, or thought other people looked
good in.  In the past I would never have dreamed of a $250 shopping
spree, but now I can pay with confidence knowing I'm buying
(relatively) high quality items that I'll wear again and again, and
that serve my life in ways I need.  I'm still a long way from the
minimal wardrobe I dream of, and I know that some of these purchases
may no doubt turn out to be mistakes. But I'll learn from those, and
continue to create a wardrobe that fits me and my life.</p>
<p>What's more,
investing in my closet and clothes that fit <em>now</em> was very empowering,
with respect to my body.  Like many American women I've struggled to
have a good relationship with my body ever since puberty.  I've never
had an eating disorder, or done anything extreme, but there are always
days that my confidence is just gone, and I find myself obsessing over
how much better I would look if I was skinnier.  I know, logically,
that this is silly: I'm perfectly healthy, and at a perfectly normal
weight and size.  I should also emphasize that, aside from one
horrible boyfriend who called me 'fat' a few times, this pressure was
always internal.  Many people in my life tell me regularly that I'm
beautiful and sexy, and I don't doubt that they mean it. But <em>I</em>
didn't feel beautiful, and that's what counts.  Investing in my
wardrobe is one small step towards loving my body <strong>every damn day</strong>,
and not letting the episodes of self-conciousness get to me.  I fit in
these clothes now, and I sure as heck don't want to buy new ones!
What's more, I don't want to buy clothes thinking &quot;I'll look so good
in these once I've lost 10 pounds&quot;.  And I didn't. And I will never,
ever do so again. If I do lose weight, then fine, I'll get new clothes
that fit.  But I'm not expecting that, or even hoping for it.  I love
my body now, and want to treat it right by putting things that feel
good on it instead of clothes that squeeze, pull, or pinch it.</p>
<p>Now that my wardrobe is set, I hope to not shop for myself until early
December, when I'll get what I need for winter. Until then, I've got
what I need!</p>
