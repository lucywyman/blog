<h2>Book Review: Harry Potter Series</h2>
<p>03.19.2016</p>
<img alt="" src="/theme/images/harry-potter.jpg" style="height: 400px;">
<p>I know: you already have some preconceived notions about Harry Potter.
We all do. The series has become an empire, with it's own movie series
and theme park, and no matter what subset of Harry Potter related
media you've experienced you have some thoughts about it. Regardless
of what those notions are -- good, bad, or ugly -- read on!  I have
had my own preconceptions about HP at various points in my life, and
after re-reading all seven books right in a row I can tell you that
many of them were turned upside down.  It may not be the series for
you, but before you go invest time in reading it, you may as well read
this way shorter blog post about it so you know what you're getting
into at least a little bit.</p>
<div class="section" id="preconceptions">
<h2>Preconceptions</h2>
<p>Like many twenty-somethings, Harry Potter was the series of my
adolescence, and I grew up with Harry, Ron, and Hermione. I stood in
line for six hours to get the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th books, dressed as
a wizard and talking to other HP fans. I went to the midnight premier
of at least three of the movies.  I wasn't the most into it of all my
friends, but I drank the Kool-Aid. However, as I picked up the first
book again a few months ago I wasn't expecting Harry Potter to be a
great series.  I expected that they would be perfectly adequate tween
novels that I had loved in my youth but now, older and wiser, would
realize I had outgrown, like <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Jackson_%26_the_Olympians">Percy Jackson</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://www.neopets.com">Neopets</a>.  I'll get
to the chase you know is coming, reader: Harry Potter is not just a
kids book.  The characters are what make these books extraordinary, as
they are all layered, multidimensional, <em>real</em> people who reflect
modern society so well.  JK Rowling is able to capture the many ways
we judge other humans in her characters, and the lengths we'll go to
defend those judgements.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-series">
<h2>The Series</h2>
<p>While the series is seven novels long, in reality it's one story
spanning seven years, that you do have to read in order and all of.
This isn't <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Ark">Animal Ark</a> people.  There's no picking one book and
saying &quot;Read this and you've read them all&quot;.  That said, <em>it's 100%
worth it</em>.  And I will say, some of the books are better than others.
My personal favorite was &quot;The Half-Blood Prince&quot;, but there is no
weak-link in the set, or book I finished and thought &quot;Man, I really
hope the next one is better&quot;. <strong>TL;DR Yes you have to read them all.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-i-loved">
<h2>What I loved</h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>The Characters</strong>. Growing up, all I remember is hating Snape. I had
no recollection of what an incredible character he is, so painfully
human and deeply entangled in the story.  The Malfoys, the Weasleys,
each delicately balanced between family and principles, conflicted
in how to choose what's best for those they love. So. Good.</li>
<li><strong>The HP Universe</strong>.  JK Rowlings universe is very well thought out,
with details like government policy, racial prejudices, and even
the <em>botany</em> of the universe created from scratch and implemented
perfectly.  Percy stresses about regulating cauldron-bottoms to be
thick enough. Neville knows the properties of Gillyweed and Devil's Snare.
History class is boring, standardized tests are stressful, and
non-wizards, muggle-born wizards, and women are all placed in a
social hierarchy similar to the racial strata that exists today.
The detail and consistency here is incredible, and makes the magical
world of Harry Potter that much more immersive and <em>real</em>.</li>
<li><strong>The Form</strong>.  Did you ever notice that there are no swear words in
Harry Potter?  And no modern technology more recent than a telephone or
TV, despite that these were written as iphones and laptops were
being developed and changing the world. It's executed so well that
you don't even notice.  There are prominent and powerful women,</li>
<li><strong>The Themes</strong>. Rowling uses Harry Potter to explore coming of age,
racism and the hatred that arises from misunderstanding, corrupt
politics, greed, the psychology of abusive relationships, and more.</li>
<li><strong>It's timeless</strong>.  My second time through I feel as though I've barely scratched the
surface of deriving meaning from this series, and the layers of
complexity make this an excellent book for readers of all ages
and stages of life. I love that the series grows with you, taking
on new meaning each time it's revisited, and it makes me so excited
to read the series again in the future and see how it changes.  The
technology (or lack thereof) also adds to this timelessness, and
even a hundred years from now the books will still be just as relevant
and relatable.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>You've made it this far: you know how I feel.  If you have any
questions, comments, or concerns, please email me at
wyman[dot]lucy[at]gmail[dot]com, and we can RAVE about how great HP is
together. In the meantime, have an excellent day, you lovely human
you.</p>
